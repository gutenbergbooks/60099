<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
WHERE IS GAWD?
</h3>

<p>
The Madden flat was hot and the smell of
frying potatoes filled it.  Two or three flies
buzzed tirelessly here and there, now and again
landing with sticky clingingness on a small
boy of four who screamed with their advent.
When this happened a girl of seven stepped
from the stove and shooed them away, saying:
"Aw now, Johnny!" and Johnny would quiet.
</p>

<p>
The perspiration stood out on her upper lip
and there were shadows, deeper than even
Irish ones should be, beneath her eyes.  The
sun beat in cruelly at one window which was
minus a shade.  At another the shade was torn
and run up crookedly.
</p>

<p>
In the hall there was the sound of a scuffle,
then a smart slap, and a child's whimpering
wail.
</p>

<p>
"What's&mdash;that?" came in a feeble voice from
the bedroom off the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"It's the new gent in the flat across whackin'
his kid," answered the small girl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," was the weak answer, and again there
was quiet, broken by the sizzle of hot fat, the
tireless buzz of the flies, and now and then the
little boy's cry.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Johnny," commanded the small
maiden, "come have your face washed
off."  Johnny objected.  She picked him up with
decision, and set him on the table with resounding
emphasis, where he screamed loudly
during the rite.
</p>

<p>
The door opened.  A man in overalls came
in.  "Hello, Paw," said Cecilia Evangeline
Agnes Madden.  He answered her with a
grunt and kicked off his heavy shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Gawd, it's hot!" he said with his first
contribution to the conversation.  "Two Dagos
got sunstruck.  One of 'em he just went like
a goldfish outa water, keeled over, then
flop,&mdash;flop.  The Boss he up an'&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Supper, Paw," said Cecilia.  She pushed
a chair up to the oil-clothed table, and the man
settled, beginning to eat loudly.  He stopped
and pointed with his knife to the bedroom
door.  "How's she?" he asked in a grating
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"She ain't so good," answered the small girl.
Her eyes filled with tears and she turned away
her face.
</p>

<p>
"Maw&mdash;Maw&mdash;Maw!" cried Johnny.
</p>

<p>
"Aw now!" said his sister while she picked
up his hot little person to comfort him.
</p>

<p>
"Maw&mdash;Maw!" he echoed.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia looked up.  Her eyes were like those
of a small dog that has been whipped.  "I ain't
the same," she said across his brick-dust curls.
"He wants <i>her</i>, I ain't the same.  I do my best,
but I ain't her."
</p>

<p>
The man laid aside his knife.  He set his
teeth on his lower lip, and then he asked a
question as if afraid to.
</p>

<p>
"Has the doctor been here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Whatud he say?"
</p>

<p>
"He sez she wasn't so good.  He sez she
wouldn't be no better 'til the weather was
cooler an'&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Celie!" came in the voice from the bedroom.
Cecilia put down Johnny.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Maw," she answered gently.
</p>

<p>
"Celie!" came again in almost a scream.
Celie vanished.  She reappeared in a few
moments.  She was whiter than before.
</p>

<p>
"She throwed up fierce," she said to her
father; "something fierce, an' all black.  Don't
you want no coffee?"  The man shook his
head.  He reached for his shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Where yuh goin'?" asked Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor's," she was answered.  He went
into the bedroom.  "Well, old woman," he said
loudly, "how yuh feelin', better?"  The thin
creature on the bed nodded, and tried to smile.
The smile was rather dreadful, for it pulled
long lines instead of bringing dimples.  Her
blue lips stretched and the lower cracked.  A
drop of blood stood out on it.
</p>

<p>
"Gawd, it was hot to-day," said the man.
He settled by her bed in a broken-backed chair.
She stretched out a thin hand toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Mary&mdash;!" he said, then choked.
</p>

<p>
"Aw, Jerry!" said the woman.  In her voice
was little Cecilia's tone of patience, with the
lilt removed by a too hard life.
</p>

<p>
"Do yuh feel <i>some</i> better?" he entreated.
</p>

<p>
"Sure&mdash;I do.  Gimme that glass of water&mdash;"  She
drank a mouthful and again vomited
rackingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gawd!" said Jeremiah Madden.  He
laid a rough hand on her forehead and she
pulled it down against her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Jerry," she said between long gasps, "I
been happy.  I want you should always
remember that I been happy.  Awful happy,
Jerry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gawd, Mary!" said the man.  "If I'd
a knew how hard you'd a had to work, I
wouldn't have brung yuh!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" she begged.  "Don't say that!"  She
looked at him, time faded, and with it a
hot and smelling flat.  She stood on a
wind-swept moor.  Jerry, only eighteen, stood by
her.  His arm was around her with that
reverent touch that comes in Irish love.  "I'll
send fer yuh," he'd said, "after I make me
fortune in America."
</p>

<p>
She had cried and clung to him.  With her
touch, reason and a rolling moor had faded for
him.  "I can't leave you," he had said, "I can't!
Mary, you come with me."  And Mary had
come.  Those days had been beautiful....
But fortunes in America did not come as
advertised.  Sometimes Mary thought of green
turf, and the gentle drip-drip of fog, like rain.
That rain that came so often....  Now she
thought of it more than ever.  She hoped that
the Virgin would allow her a little corner of
Heaven that would look like an Irish moor....
The gold the priest talked of was "grand,"
but heresy or not, she wanted a bit of green,
with the gentle drip of rain on it.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah bent and kissed her.  Then he
rubbed the spot of blood of her lip from his.
"It wasn't no mistake," he said.  Her eyes
grew moist.
</p>

<p>
"Jerry," she said, "Celie is a good kid.  She
kin do fer yuh.  Ain't she, right along?  She
won't give yuh no trouble neither.  But the
kid&mdash;he ain't so easy.  It's the kids growin'
up in America better'n their folks, that go to
the devil.  Watch him, Jerry, watch him good.
Won't yuh now?"  The man nodded; she closed
her eyes.  After a few moments that throbbed
with the heat of the flat, she spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Jerry," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Darlin'?"
</p>

<p>
"It's this way, Jerry.  I always wanted to
be a lady&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yuh are!" he interrupted hotly.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-018"></a>

<br />
&quot;NOW LAUGH!  PAW'S COMING HOME AND <br />
HE NEEDS ALL OUR LAUGHS&quot;
</p>

<p>
"No," she stated quietly, "I ain't, an' I
always thought I could be.  The Irish learns
fast.  It's this way, Jerry; if ever the time
comes when you get money, you send Celie
to one of them schools that learns 'em French
and drawin' and such, Jerry, will yuh?"
</p>

<p>
"Before Gawd, I will, Mary.  If I ever kin."
</p>

<p>
She closed her eyes and slept quietly,
clinging to his hand.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next day was Sunday so Jeremiah went
to Mass and heard it with especial intention.
If his thoughts were more on the gentle Saint
slowly dying in a hot flat than on the Gentle
Mother, who can blame him.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah went from the baroqued church
vastly comforted, and painfully aware of his
Sunday collar, which had rough edges.  Cecilia
had rubbed soap on it, but it still scratched.
Outside Jeremiah went, not in the direction
of his home, but in the other.  He passed a
beggar's entreating wail, and then retraced his
steps to bestow a penny,&mdash;and even pennies
were not easily spared.  Jerry was still a little
child at heart.  He was courting divine favour.
He needed God and all the Saints on his side.
</p>

<p>
After a brisk walk of many blocks he turned
into a house with a doctor's sign on it.  The
office was crowded; he sat, outwardly submissive,
to wait his turn.  "Blessed Mother," he
prayed, "make him mak'er well.  Mother of the
Saviour&mdash;" his thoughts were a chaos.  "A gold
heart!" he promised rashly, even while he
remembered the unpaid grocer's bill.  A woman
with a pallid skin and hacking cough crept
from the office.  Across from him a boy
exhibited a burn to an interested neighbour.
"Blessed Mother,&mdash;" entreated Jeremiah, even
while his eyes saw the burn and he wondered
how it had happened.
</p>

<p>
A crisp young person in white, who gave an
impression of great coolness, said, "Your turn
next."  Jerry jumped and got up.  Two little
girls, at the Sheraton period in legs,
giggled loudly at his jump, but Jerry didn't
notice.  He stopped on the threshold of the
inner office.  He twirled his hat in his hands.
"Mister," he said, "it's my wife I come about."  The
doctor had been up all night.  Added to
his fact was the fact that he was fitted,
emotionally, to run a morgue.
</p>

<p>
"Name?" growled the doctor.  Jeremiah
Madden sank to a chair and told his name, of
his wife, and how sick she was.  He also
interspersed a few facts about Irish moors, love and
business in America.  And he ended with:
"An my doc he sez' no one can save her but
Doctor Van Dorn.  He's the cancer man of
New York.  The only one who can possibly
save her!  He sez that," repeated Jeremiah.
"Oh fer Gawd's sake, Doc!  I can't pay yuh
now but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The doctor swung about in his swivel chair.
"My time is entirely mortgaged," he stated
curtly.  "I can't keep up to my work.  Your
wife will probably die anyway; accept the
inevitable.  You couldn't pay me, and I haven't
the time.  All New York bothers me.  Good
morning."
</p>

<p>
He turned back to his desk.  Jeremiah went
toward the door.  His step was a blind shuffle.
Hand on the knob, he paused.  "Doc," he said,
"I love her so, an' the little kids, they need her.
I feel like she'd live if you'd help her.  I
promise I'd pay.  All my life I'd pay an' thank
Gawd I could&mdash;" he stopped.  The doctor
moved his shoulders impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"The Virgin will reward yuh&mdash;" said Jeremiah.
"Oh, Doc!  Fer Gawd's sake!"
</p>

<p>
"Good morning," answered the doctor with
another impatient move of his shoulders.
Jeremiah left.  A young person in crisp white said,
"Your turn next, Madam."  Madam went in.
"Oh, Doctor, my heart&mdash;" she began.  The
doctor got up to move her chair so that the
light would not trouble her.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jeremiah spent the morning in going from
office to office.  First he told the unfavourable
report of his doctor.  He met sympathy in
some quarters, curt refusals in others, and
worst of all he sometimes met: "Cancer of
the stomach?  Not much chance&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At half after one, sick from the sunlight of
the cruelly hot streets, he turned into an office
for his last try.  He felt numb....  His tongue
was thick.  He looked with resentment on a
well-dressed woman who waited opposite him.
"Flowers on her bunnit," he thought, "while
my Mary&mdash;"  He thought of his hard labour
and, with bitterness, of the "Boss."  He had
never felt this way before.  If he'd had money,
he reflected, how quickly that first doctor
would have helped him....  The other refusals
had come from truer reasons.  His own doctor's
report, although Jeremiah didn't realise
this, had stopped all efforts.  If the doctor had
said no one but Van Dorn could help her,
Lord, what chance had they?  This was their
line of reason.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah sat in the outer waiting room.  At
last his turn came.  The doctor looked tired;
he was gruff in his questions.  "I'll come with
you and look at her," he said at last.  Jeremiah
felt a sob rise in his throat.  The doctor rang
a bell.
</p>

<p>
"Tell Miss Evelyn," he said to the maid
who answered him, "that we'll have to give
up our drive this afternoon.  She's my little
girl," he explained to Jeremiah.  "Her
mother's dead,&mdash;I don't see as much of her
as I should.  A doctor has no business with
a family.  I'm ready.  Come on."
</p>

<p>
They went out by a back door, leaving an
office full of patients.  The sun was hot.
Jeremiah prayed fervently even while he answered
the doctor's questions and responded to his
pleasantries.  At last they came to the building
which held Jeremiah's home.  They mounted
the long stairs.  Two or three children,
playing on them, stopped their squabbling and
looked after the doctor with awe.
</p>

<p>
"He's got a baby in that case," said one, a
fat little girl with aggressive pig-tails.
</p>

<p>
"There is too many now," said a boy.  "They
don't all get fed, and they're all beat up fierce.
Our teacher in that there corner mission sez
as how Gawd is love.  Why don't he come
down here an' love?"
</p>

<p>
There was an awed silence after this.  Outright
heresy as it was, the immediate descent
of a thunderbolt was expected.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Upstairs Jeremiah opened the door of the
flat.  The kitchen was full of women.
Several of them sobbed loudly....  Johnny Madden
sat on the table, eating a piece of bread
thickly spread with molasses.  On seeing
Jeremiah the women were suddenly silent.
Jeremiah swayed and leaned against the door.
</p>

<p>
The small Cecilia heard him and came from
the bedroom.
</p>

<p>
"Paw," she said, "I'll do all I kin fer yuh.
I always will....  She was happy.  She sez as
how she seen green fields an' rain."  Jeremiah
took her in his arms.  He hid his face against
her thin little shoulder.  His shook.  Cecilia
was very quiet.  She had not cried.  She looked
over her father's head at the roomful of gaping
women.  Something flashed across her face.
Her teeth set.
</p>

<p>
"She always wanted a bunnit with pink
roses on it," said Cecilia.  "I don't see why
Gawd didn't give her jest <i>one</i>."
</p>

<p>
The man sobbed convulsively and Cecilia
remembered him.  "She was happy," Cecilia said
in a less assured tone.  "She sez as how she
seen green fields with rain on 'em like Ireland."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
THE VISION OF A PROMISED LAND
</h3>

<p>
As Mrs. Madden had said, "The kids that
grow up better than their folks go to the
devil."  Cecilia felt this at eleven, for she was
all of Johnny's mother, and the role was a
difficult one.  She had learned to spat him and kiss
him judiciously, and at the proper times.  She
had learned to understand his marble games
and to coax him into attendance at Catechism.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had begun to understand a great
many things at eleven that some of us never
understand.  One thing made learning easy
for her,&mdash;she loved so greatly that she was
often submerged into the loved, and so saw
their viewpoint.
</p>

<p>
"Paw," said Cecilia.  She had turned about
on the piano stool, and Jeremiah looked up
from his paper.  "Well?" he questioned.
</p>

<p>
"I been thinking," she said, "that it would be
genteel to ask the priest to supper.  It ain't
as though we hadn't a hired girl to do fer us,
an' it would be polite."
</p>

<p>
"That's so, that's so," said Jeremiah.  He
laid aside his paper.  "You're like your maw,"
he added.  Cecilia knew he was pleased.  She
smiled happily.
</p>

<p>
"An' have ice-cream?" suggested the
interested Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Cecilia, "an' chicken, an' fried
potatoes, an' waffles, an' of course pie, an'
biscuits, an' suchlike.  I'd like to entertain Father
McGowan, he's been good to us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Jeremiah.  They were both
silent.  The vision of an overcrowded and
smelling flat had come to sober them.  Also
the memory that always went with it....
"Play me 'The Shepherd Boy,'" said Jeremiah.
He closed his eyes while Cecilia banged
it out in very uneven tempo, owing to
difficulties in the bass.
</p>

<p>
Johnny came in.  He sat down on a lounge
covered with a green and red striped cloth.
He looked at Jeremiah with a supercilious
expression.
</p>

<p>
"The other fellahs' fathers wears their shoes
in the house," he stated coldly.  "The
Shepherd Boy" stopped suddenly.  Cecilia went
toward the "parlor."  "Johnny!" she called on
reaching it.  Johnny followed meekly.  The
parlor was the torture chamber.  When he
went in Cecilia put her hands on his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Johnny," she said in her gentle little way.
"Um?" he answered, wriggling beneath her
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Johnny," she repeated, "it ain't polite to
call down your paw."
</p>

<p>
"But Celie," objected John, "he ain't like
the other fellahs' fathers.  They wears collars
an' shoes, <i>all</i> the time."
</p>

<p>
"I know, dear," said Cecilia.  "I know, but
it ain't polite to call down your paw, an'
nothing can make it so."
</p>

<p>
"Aw right," answered John sullenly.  Cecilia
leaned over and kissed him.  John didn't
mind, "none of the fellahs being around."  He
went back to the living room.  Jeremiah
had put on his shoes.  He looked at Johnny,
awaiting his approval.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"An' Norah," said Cecilia, excited to the
point of hysteria, "you see that I get the plate
with the crack in it, an' the glass with the
piece outa it."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I will," answered Norah.  "Now
go 'long."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia went to the dining room.  They were
going to eat there, because they were going to
have company.  Norah was not going to sit
down with them either.  It was to be most
formal and "elegant."
</p>

<p>
And now for the decorations.  Cecilia put
on two candlesticks, each at a corner of the
table.  They did not match, but why be
particular?  Then she took a bunch of peonies,
and, removing all foliage, jammed them tightly
in a vase that had the shape of a petrified
fibroid growth, and had accumulated gilt, and
a seascape for decoration.
</p>

<p>
"It looks bare," said Cecilia.  She went to
her room and brought out a new hair-ribbon,
worn only twice.  She unearthed this from
below a hat trimmed with pink roses.  The hat
was gorgeous and beautiful, but she could not
wear it....  Looking on "bunnits with pink
roses on 'em" always made her a little sick.
The hair-ribbon was tied around the vase in
a huge bow.  Cecilia stood off to admire.
</p>

<p>
"Norah!" she called.
</p>

<p>
Norah appeared.  "Ain't that grand?" she
commented.  "Now ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered Cecilia, "I don't care if
I do say it, I think it's pretty swell!  Norah,
you use the blue glass butter dish, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," answered Norah, and then with
mutters of waffle batter, she disappeared.
Cecilia stood a moment longer looking at the
table in all its beauty.  The plates were upside
down.  Napkins (that all matched) stood
upright in tumblers.  The knives and forks were
crossed in what was to Cecilia the most artistic
angle.
</p>

<p>
"It's grand!" she said with a little catch in
her breath.  "Just <i>swell</i>!"  Then with a backward
glance, she vanished.  "I hope paw'll like
it," she muttered as she went upstairs.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Father McGowan was a charming guest.
He looked at the decorations and then on the
small Cecilia with softened eyes: "Now I'll
bet you fixed this beautiful table!" he said.
Cecilia nodded, speechless.  She drew a long,
shaky breath.  Life was so beautiful....
Father McGowan put his hand on her curls.
(She sat next to him at the table.)  His touch
was very gentle.
</p>

<p>
"Good little woman?" inquired the priest
of Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
"She's maw and all to all of us," answered
Jeremiah.  There was a silence while they ate.
</p>

<p>
"This chicken," said Father McGowan, "is fine!"
</p>

<p>
"It's too brown, I'm afraid," answered
Cecilia with the deprecatory attitude proper
while speaking of one's own food.  Her father
looked at her with pride.  The priest's eyes
twinkled.
</p>

<p>
"Paw," said Cecilia, leaning across the table
and putting her hand on her father's, "tell
Father McGowan how yuh hit the boss on the
ear with the brick."  Jeremiah sat back in his
chair, first laying his knife and fork with the
eating ends on the plate and the others on the
cloth.  He drew a long breath and told a long
tale, at which the priest laughed heartily.  He
ended it thus: "An' I sez, 'I ain't <i>dee</i>pendent
on no man.  Yuh can do yer own brick layin'
an' here's one to start with!'"  With that
Jerry had hit him on the ear.  It was a
dramatic tale, and one which made Cecilia swell
with pride over a wonderful paw!
</p>

<p>
The priest leaned across the table.  "Have
you a patent protection on those bricks?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no," answered Jeremiah.  The priest
talked long and fast.  Cecilia could not
understand all of what he said, but he mentioned
unusual qualities of Jeremiah's product.  His
own knowledge of such things came through
a brother in the same business.  The necessity
of a little risk and a big push.  He talked
loudly, and excitedly.  He mentioned Cecilia
and John as the incentive to gain....  He
spoke of what he knew to be true of Jeremiah's
product.  Jeremiah sat very silent.  If what
the priest said were true!  They went to the
living room, where, over a pitcher of beer, there
was more talk, incomprehensible to Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
Then the priest smiled, and said: "All right,
Jerry.  In five years you'll be a millionaire.
Now, Cecilia, I want to hear a piece."  Cecilia
sat down to play "The Shepherd Boy."  Her
fingers trembled so that it wasn't as good as
usual, but the priest was pleased.  Then she
left, and wiped the rest of the dishes for Norah.
Norah said that the priest was a "swell talker"
and that she hadn't minded the extra work.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia went up to bed very happy.  She
slipped out of her pink silk dress and hung it
in the closet.  As she reached up, a hat, all
over bobbing roses, slid from the closet shelf
to the floor.  Cecilia's smile faded.  She put it
back, and shut the door.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
THE FIRST STEP INTO CANAAN
</h3>

<p>
Cecilia stood in her bedroom in the new
house.  The paper in her bedroom was pink
and hung in panels.  At the top of each panel
was a hip-diseased, and goitered cupid, who
threw roses around,&mdash;roses that looked like
frozen cabbages, and stuck in the air as if
they'd been glued there.  Father Madden had
picked out the paper as a surprise for Celie.
When she had seen it she had gasped and then
kissed him very hard.  He had said, "There,
Celie, I knew you'd like it."
</p>

<p>
After he had gone Cecilia had looked around
and said, "Oh, dear&mdash;Oh, dear!"  Roses always
had made her sick, and even to Cecilia, the
paper was "pretty bad."  And Cecilia had
kissed him hard and said she loved it.
</p>

<p>
Some one tapped on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan's down," said Norah
with a point of her finger over her left shoulder.
"An' the man's down with doughnuts, too."
Cecilia laughed.  Norah's mode of announcement
always made people sound diseased.  Cecilia
had a mental picture of a man in the
throes of doughnuts&mdash;with them breaking out
all over his person.
</p>

<p>
"You can take a dozen and a half," said
Cecilia, referring to the doughnut-man,
"because Johnny likes them so."
</p>

<p>
Norah didn't move, but stood in the doorway
surveying the tumbled room.  A trunk stood
in the centre, lid thrown back.  From it exuded
frills and tails.  The bed was piled high with
more frilly garb.  Norah sniffed loudly.
Suddenly, there were sobs and then she dissolved
into many tears.  "I dunno how we can do
without yuh!" she explained in gulps.  "Me,
and Johnny and your paw.  Aw, <i>Celie</i>!"  Cecilia
put her arms around the troubled Norah.
She looked very near tears herself.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather stay with you, but maw
wanted me learned to be a lady," she said.  Her
chin set.  "I gotta do it," she added.  "Paw
promised her."  Norah sniffed and took the
apron from her face.  "I know yuh gotta,
dearie," she answered.  Celie put her arms
around the damp Norah.  "Norah," she said,
"you will be very good to Johnny and paw?
When Johnny wants paw to wear collars all
the time, you take him out and give him
doughnuts to divert him, will yuh?"  Norah nodded.
She was sniffing again.
</p>

<p>
"And, Norah," went on Celie, "don't let the
new cook use the blue glass butter dish everyday."
</p>

<p>
"N-no, dearie," answered Norah.  She still
stood irresolute by the door.  "Celie," she
said, "when they learn yuh to be a lady, don't
let 'em learn yuh not to love us."
</p>

<p>
"I'll <i>always</i> love you all," answered Cecilia.
Her eyes filled with tears, and she kissed
Norah.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Downstairs Father McGowan sat looking at
a gilt cabinet decorated with forget-me-nots,
and a variety of chrysanthemums never seen
on sea or land.  On the top shelf of the cabinet
was a brick, lying on a red velvet bed.  Father
McGowan smiled and then sobered.  He remembered
a night three years past when he had
pointed out possibilities to Jeremiah Madden,
possibilities in the manufacture of the humble
brick.  The possibilities had amounted to more
than even he had anticipated.  Sometimes he
questioned what he had done....  His hope
lay in Cecilia.  The boy, he was afraid, would
not be helped by money.  Perhaps he'd turn
out well.  Father McGowan hoped so.  He'd
bet on Cecilia anyway.  She'd use money in
the right way in a few more years.
</p>

<p>
There was a rustle at the door.  Cecilia, in
a new gown bought to wear at the "swell
school," came in.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan, dear!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia Madden, dear!" he answered.  They
both laughed, and then settled.
</p>

<p>
"Have you come to tell me to be a good girl
at the swell school?" she questioned.  The
father was silent.  He was looking at Cecilia's
dress.  The dress was of purple silk with a
green velvet vest.  There were ribbons looped
carelessly on its gorgeousness too.
</p>

<p>
"Little Celie," said Father McGowan, "I
want to tell you things and I can't.  Now if
you had a mother!  Sometimes women do
come in handy."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I want to tell you," said Father McGowan,
looking hard at the brick, "not to be hurt if
at first the girls are stand-offish like.  That's
their way."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Cecilia.  "I won't be, but I
think they'll be nice.  Mrs. De Pui says they're
all of the best families with wonderful home
advantages."
</p>

<p>
"Hum&mdash;" grunted Father McGowan.  He
did not seem much impressed.  He still gave
the brick his undivided attention.  "And," he
went on, "if you should get lonely, remember
that there's one Lady you can always tell your
troubles to.  She won't laugh, and she always
listens."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>yes</i>!" said Cecilia, and she crossed herself.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan drew a long breath.
"Now," he said, "remember that if your clothes
are different from theirs that your father has
plenty of money to buy new ones for you.
Remember that.  A penance is all right, but
not at fourteen."
</p>

<p>
"Why, my clothes are beautiful!" said
Cecilia.  She looked bewildered.  "They're all
silk and lace and velvet, and I haven't a low
heeled pair of shoes.  <i>French</i> heels, Father
McGowan, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia Madden, dear," said Father
McGowan.  His look was inscrutable.  He laid
a hand on her hair.  His touch was very gentle.
"Most of all," he said, "remember never to be
ashamed of your people, and always to love
them.  Love those who love you.  Reason the
truth out in your heart, and don't accept the
standards of little Miss Millionairess, because
she is that.  Understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Cecilia, "I understand, but
Father McGowan, I would always love paw.
Wearing shoes and collars in the house is just
the trimmings," she stated bravely.  "His
heart is genteel."
</p>

<p>
"Saint Cecilia!" said Father McGowan in
a low voice, and then he muttered a few words
in Latin.  Cecilia did not understand them,
but she bowed her head and crossed herself,
and felt strong.
</p>

<p>
After Father McGowan left she stood in
front of a mirror admiring a purple silk dress
with green velvet trimmings.  "Holy Mary,"
she said with quickly closed eyes, "help me
not to be too stuck on my clothes!"  When
she opened her eyes she looked into the mirror.
"Oh, it's grand!" she whispered.  "I am almost
pretty in it!"  She drew a long, shaking breath.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The room in which Cecilia waited, while not
at all like her home, impressed her.  Most
of the furniture looked old, and some of it
showed a cracking veneer.  The clock especially
needed repair.  It was a grandfather one,
and had inlaid figures of white wood on the
dark.  Cecilia wondered vaguely if it couldn't
be repaired and shone up?  Dilapidated as
she thought the furnishing, yet it left an
impress.  Two girls entered the room, they
looked at Cecilia and tried not to smile.
Cecilia wondered uncomfortably if her hat were
on crooked, or whether her red silk petticoat
hung out.
</p>

<p>
They selected books from a low case with
leisure, then left.  Outside the door Cecilia
heard them giggle.  One of them said, "Some
one's cook."
</p>

<p>
"Every one has trouble with cooks," thought
Cecilia.  Then she looked down and forgot
cooks.  Her shoes were so beautiful!  Pointed
toes and high of heels.  And her suit now,
all over braid and buttons, with a touch of red
here and there!
</p>

<p>
Even those giggling girls must have been
impressed.  Their clothes had been so plain.
Cecilia pitied them.  She decided to give them
a "tasty" hair-ribbon now and then....  The
waiting was so long.  She wished Mrs. De Pui
would come.  She thought of paw and Johnny
and her eyes filled with hot tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she thought miserably, "if Johnny
just won't reform paw!  People are so happy
when they aren't reforming or being reformed!"
</p>

<p>
Again she saw the station at which she'd
started for Boston, her father and Johnny
both sniffing.  She was so glad she hadn't cried.
She had so wanted to!  Her breath caught in
her throat.  "Please, Gawd," she made mental
appeal, "make them learn me to be a lady
quick!"
</p>

<p>
Weren't they <i>ever</i> coming?
</p>

<p>
The shabby clock tick-tick-ticked.  The sun
lowered and made more slanting rays on the
floor.  A maid, very smart in uniform, came
in.  She gave Cecilia a guilty look, then said:
"This way.  Mrs. De Pui will see you upstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ma'am," answered Cecilia.  She
followed humbly.  The maid decided that her
forgetfulness hadn't made much difference.
She didn't think that <i>that</i> would report
her....  Cecilia went upstairs after the
slender black figure.  Her heart beat
sickeningly.  There were voices from the door at
which the maid paused.  Cecilia saw some girls
sitting around a table at which a white-haired
woman was pouring tea.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Cecilia impulsively, "I'm
interrupting yuh at yer supper."
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Mrs. De Pui, faintly smiling;
"come in.  You are Cecilia?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia nodded.  Somehow the sobs that had
been kept in all day, were, at the first kind
voice, very near the surface.  The girls smiled
at each other.  Cecilia wondered about her hat,
or perhaps her petticoat hung out below her
skirt?  Mrs. De Pui motioned her to a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Annette," she said, "give our new friend
some tea."
</p>

<p>
"How do you take your tea?" questioned
Annette crisply.
</p>

<p>
"Milk," answered Cecilia, "an' sugar if yuh
have it."  She reddened.  Of course they would
have it.  She wished she hadn't said that!  She
stared in acute embarrassment at her feet.
Some one gave her a cup of tea, some one else
a sandwich.  She dipped it in the tea, then
she remembered that that was not proper and
reddened again.  At that move the young
person called Annette had suddenly choked and
held her handkerchief over her mouth.  The
other girls looked into their cups, with the
corners of their lips twitching.
</p>

<p>
A fat and dumpy-looking girl seated a
little out of the group looked at Cecilia with
sympathy.  Mrs. De Pui spoke of a recent
exhibition of water colours, with her well-bred
tones trickling over the inanities she uttered,
and making them sound like a reflection of
thought....  Even the sun looked cold to
Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I was back in the flat," she thought,
and then: "I wonder if I can bear it!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
LEARNING
</h3>

<p>
A month had passed.  Cecilia quite
understood what Father McGowan had meant about
clothes.  Cecilia wore no more French heels.
She had taken down her hair and discarded
her beautiful rhinestone hair-pins.  Father
McGowan too, it seemed, had been responsible
for her admittance to the school.  Cecilia had
found out from Mrs. De Pui that he had
written a book!  This astounding fact had been
divulged after Mrs. De Pui, more than usually
tried by Cecilia, had said: "Your entrance here
has been rather difficult for me.  You see, of
course, that the other girls' advantages have
not been yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Mrs. De Pui," answered Cecilia,
and swallowed hard.
</p>

<p>
"Realising that, my dear," continued Mrs. De
Pui, "I hope that you will do your utmost
to develop a womanly sympathy, and
broaden your character."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia said somewhat breathlessly that she
would try to, very, very hard!  "And," went on
Mrs. De Pui, then coughed, "desist from the
use of such words as 'elegant,'&mdash;'refined'
(which, when used at all, is re<i>fine</i>d, not
'r<i>ee</i>fined'), and 'grand.'  Such words, my dear
Cecilia, are not used in&mdash;&mdash;" (Mrs. De Pui
nearly said polite society, but swallowed it with
a horrified gulp) "are not used by persons of
cultivation," she finished weakly.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia vanished.  She went to her lonely
room.  (There were no room-mates.)  She
settled on the bed.  By the bed, on a chair, was
a pink silk dress.  It had been her star play,
and after a month of boarding school she was
going to give it to the maid.  The maid was
<i>so</i> friendly!
</p>

<p>
There were two letters on the small dressing
table.  Cecilia got them and read:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Celie girl, we miss you.  It ain't like it was
in the house.  I hope they are learning you
good and the board is good.  I hope they treat
you good.  Father McGowan was here last
night.  He sez he will go to see you soon.
Johnny is well.  Norah sez your cat is lonely
too.  Your father with love,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"J. MADDEN."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The other was a line from John.  A petulant
line, full of querulous complaint of a collarless
father, redeemed to Cecilia by a word or two at
the end.
</p>

<p>
"You were so good to me, Celie.  I know it
now."  She threw herself down on the bed.
Her shoulders shook miserably.  Tears wet a
once loved pink silk dress, "all over beads and
lace."
</p>

<p>
Upstairs in another room, a group of girls
were laughing uncontrollably.  "You know
she actually invited Annie to <i>sit</i> down!" said
one.  (Annie was the slender maid.)
</p>

<p>
"That is not r<i>ee</i>fined," answered Annette.
There was more wild laughter.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Do</i> ask her up to-night," suggested a tawny
haired maiden with cat-green eyes.  "<i>Do!</i>  It
would be simply <i>screamingly</i> funny!"
</p>

<p>
Annette, although one of the most unkind,
objected.  "It doesn't seem quite nice," she
said.  However, as the idea promised fun, the
majority ruled.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia answered the tap on her door.
"Come up to your room to-night?" she echoed
after the invitation.  "Oh, Miss Annette, I'd
be that glad to come!" she smiled, and her
smile was like sunshine after rain.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>do</i> thank you!" she said.  "I do!"
</p>

<p>
Annette turned away.  Cecilia closed the
door, then she covered her eyes.  "Gawd,
thank you ever so much!" she whispered,
"thank you!  I <i>have</i> been so lonely!  Make
them love me.  Please make them love me,
Gawd."  Then she lifted her head.  Her face
shone.  "I wonder what I shall wear?" she
said.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To meet the ideal of one's dreams while
carrying a sick cat is humiliating.  And that is
what happened to Cecilia Evangeline Agnes
Madden.  Her shadowy dream-knight had
materialised into human shape through a
photograph.  And she met him while
chaperoning a sick cat.
</p>

<p>
Two weeks before she had gone to a party
in Annette Twombly's room.  She'd not enjoyed
the party very much, in fact she'd been
rather unhappy until she saw the photograph.
After that she didn't care what happened.  All
the romance of the Celt had leaped....  Her
shadowy dreams took form.  The ideal lover
developed a body.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, your <i>heavenly</i> cousin, Annette!" said
the green-eyed.  "I <i>adore</i> his hair!" She stood
before a large photograph, framed elaborately.
</p>

<p>
"He <i>is</i> a sweet boy," Annette had responded,
"but so particular!  I never knew any one
quite so fastidious.  It is <i>fearfully</i> hard to
please him!"
</p>

<p>
"Does he get crushes?" asked the green-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Annette, "it would be
impossible.  He's terribly intellectual and all that,
and girls so easily offend him.  He doesn't
say so, but he simply stops paying them any
attention."
</p>

<p>
The group gathered about the picture to
admire.  It showed a rather nice looking boy,
with an outdoor flavour, and eyes that
questioned....  The face was too young to have
character.
</p>

<p>
"He's had on long trousers for six years!"
said Annette.  There was a hushed silence.
"Isn't he <i>divine</i>!" gurgled one young person at
length.  Cecilia had only looked.  The
shadowy dream man vanished.  The picture
boy took his place.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This day Cecilia walked alone as usual.
Mrs. De Pui was an advocate of trust as a
developer of "womanly instinct," so on a
stipulated number of streets, the girls were allowed
to walk unchaperoned.  They went in little
groups, all except Cecilia.  She was her own
small group.
</p>

<p>
To-day she walked alone, at least it seemed
so, but by her Cecilia felt K. Stuyvesant
Twombly.  "I admire art," he was saying.
His voice, curiously enough, was Mrs. De
Pui's.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," agreed Cecilia.  "Beauty develops
us, the best of us, and brings a shining
light into the soul."  Cecilia stopped.  Then
because she was very truthful she went on:
"That is not original.  The man who lectures
us on Art said it.  He has whiskers and false
teeth, I believe, for they click when he says,
'Renaissance.'" ... "Oh, Heavens!" thought
Cecilia, "I will never be a lady.  That would
not be the way to talk to the ideal man.  About
teeth!&mdash;false ones!"
</p>

<p>
Then the cat had appeared.  Rather Cecilia
had nearly walked on it.  It was a limp little
grey and white heap, its fur half wet from
the gutter, and eyes half closed.
</p>

<p>
"Poor pussy," said Cecilia.  "You look like
I feel when I'm with them what have social
advantages.  Poor pussy!"  She was very
tender toward it.  She leaned above it, then
picked it up.  "I will bribe Annie, with dresses,
to feed it," she thought.  The cat began to be
violently ill.  Cecilia put it down.
</p>

<p>
"I say!" came in a rather husky voice,
"Pussy needs some Mothersill's, doesn't she?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia didn't understand the allusion, but
she looked up smiling.  The voice had been
attractively hearty.  After she looked up, she
gasped.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with it?" went
on the young man.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd take it to my school and get
the hired girl,&mdash;I mean maid,&mdash;to feed it."
</p>

<p>
"No," objected K. Stuyvesant; "it's
poisoned.  We'll take it to a drug store and get
them to kill it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>no</i>!" said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"See here," said the boy, "the cat will die.
I've had dogs of mine poisoned.  It's the most
merciful thing to have it killed.  It'll only
suffer and drag its life out if you take it
home."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Cecilia.  "I suppose you know.
It's just as you say."
</p>

<p>
"Good kid," he commented.  His comment
called forth an agony and elation.  Cecilia
wished for the longer dresses with which she'd
come to school.  The boy picked up the cat
gently and wrapped his handkerchief about it.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," he said.  "Drug store around
the corner."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia followed.  She could not keep up to
him.  Half the time she ran.  The whole
affair was humiliating.
</p>

<p>
"Thank the Lord no one saw me!" said the
boy when they got inside the drug store.  He
looked at Cecilia.  They both laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," he said.  "I'm going to buy you
a soda."  Cecilia sat down.  "Choclut," she
ordered.  He sat down opposite her, and put
his arms on the sticky little table.  He thought
he looked on the prettiest child he'd ever seen....
She seemed entirely and only a child.
</p>

<p>
"What's your name?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia Evangeline Agnes Madden," she
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Cecilia Evangeline," he said, "don't
try to eat the bottom of the glass; I'm
wealthy to-day.  I'm going to buy you another
soda!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," answered Cecilia, "I really oughtn't."  At
a motion the clerk bent above her.  "C-could
I have a sundae?" asked Cecilia.  The boy
laughed and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Peach," said Cecilia, "with a good deal of
whipped cream on top, if you please!" She
smiled frankly on K. Stuyvesant.  "I'm
having a <i>fine</i> time!" she said.  Her sentimental
dreams of him had vanished.  He didn't talk
a bit like the phantom, but he was <i>nicer</i>!
</p>

<p>
"What's your name, please?" she asked.
She knew, but little Cecilia at fourteen was
a woman.
</p>

<p>
"Keefer Stuyvesant Twombly," he answered.
"Rotten name.  Imagine being
hailed as 'Keefer'!  It sounds like some one's
butler.  It isn't a nice name, is it, Evangeline
Cecilia?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Cecilia.  "But then, you are nice.
Names and things are just trimmings.  <i>You</i>
are nice," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"So are you," returned the boy, "and I'll <i>bet</i>
you're Irish!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>How</i> did you know?" asked Cecilia, wide-eyed.
"How did you know?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And there she sat," said the green-eyed,
"laughing with him in the most brazen way,
and he bought her two sodas!"
</p>

<p>
"How vulgar," said Annette.  "Was he
good looking?"
</p>

<p>
"Ravishing, my dear.  Alice thought that
he looked like your cousin."
</p>

<p>
"That, of course, is impossible," said
Annette coldly.  "He <i>does</i> happen to be here.
He and his mother are at the Touraine.  But
as for his looking at any one like that Madden
girl&mdash;!  How she got in here, I can't imagine.
I think that it is an imposition to be
asked to meet her."
</p>

<p>
Annette surveyed her hair, and picked up
a mirror.  "Did you tell Mrs. De Pui?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the green-eyed; "I thought
that it was my <i>duty</i>.  It hurt me to do it, but I
thought I <i>ought</i> to.  We watched them for
the longest time.  We pretended to be looking
at a window full of hot water bottles."
</p>

<p>
Alice came in.  She picked up the photograph
of K. Stuyvesant Twombly.  She nodded
at the green-eyed after she looked long....
Annette saw this in the glass and glared.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
DISGRACE
</h3>

<p>
The day had been terrible for Cecilia.  She
had learned from Mrs. De Pui that she had
hopelessly offended....  What she had done,
Mrs. De Pui said, was an act suitable for
one of the maids.  Mrs. De Pui was pained.
She could not believe that one of her pupils,
with the womanly inspiration of the school set
before her, could have so offended.  It was unthinkable!
</p>

<p>
Cecilia wriggled, and swallowed with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"Cultivate repose," ordered Mrs. De Pui
coldly.  Cecilia stood so rigidly that she looked
like a wooden Indian.  One of the girls
entered.  She said, "Excuse me," and backed
away, plainly much interested.
</p>

<p>
"What was the boy's name, Cecilia?" asked
Mrs. De Pui.  Cecilia swallowed so hard that
she shook.  "I don't know," she answered
loudly.
</p>

<p>
Then what Mrs. De Pui said was very
terrible.  Cecilia crawled off at last, white and
shaking.  She groped for her door knob.
Things before her were not very clear.  What
Mrs. De Pui had said was very terrible, but,&mdash;but
the other, her first lie, uttered with that
brazen assurance....  She went in and threw
herself across the bed....  She didn't cry.
The hurt was too big.  So her dear father and
the fact that she was born in poverty made
her an outcast?  If so, she would stay so.
"Learn her to be a lady," the breeze that came
in through an inch opened window whispered.
Cecilia felt it, and set her chin.
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. De Pui hadn't believed her story.
Hadn't believed her....  "One more try,
Cecilia, although you are a great trial both
to me and my pupils," echoed through her
brain in Mrs. De Pui's cold tones.  Cecilia
sat upright on the bed.  "My heart's right,"
she said aloud.  "I believe it's better than
Annette's.  Don't that count for nothing?
Ain't being kind being a lady?"  She stared
sullenly across the room.  The white furniture
glittered coldly.  From between the flutter of
scrim curtains she saw a painfully well
arranged park.  Even the trees were smugly
superior.
</p>

<p>
"Gawd <i>was</i> in that flat," she said, and
again aloud.  A sentence came to her mind.
A sentence that is shopworn and has been
on the top shelf for many years.  "I guess Gawd
is what I feel fer paw,&mdash;" she said, half
musingly,&mdash;"Love.  An' fer Johnny, even when
he's bad, an' Father McGowan, dear, an'
Norah.  Just that." ... She looked out of the
window and saw the painfully well regulated
trees again.  "Them trees ain't so bad," she
stated; "at least they ain't when I remember
that they love me at home."  Her face changed,
for she remembered some of Mrs. De Pui's
well-aimed truths.  Her father,&mdash;his difference.
It should always be hers, too, she decided.
</p>

<p>
Her first touch of hate came.  "Gawd, make
me a lady quick!" she implored.  Some one
tapped on the door.  Cecilia opened it.  Annie
was there, beaming.  She held a long box with
stems sticking out of one end of it.  "Fer you,
dearie," said Annie.  Cecilia opened the box
with trembling hands.  The box held pink
roses, very, very pink roses....  On the top
lay a card.  On it was written in a loose,
boy-hand: "For little
'A-good-deal-of-whipped-cream-on-top.'"  Cecilia
stared at the card,
breathless.
</p>

<p>
"Annie," she-said at last, "ain't they lovely?"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't, dearie," corrected Annie, and then
added, "You bet they are!  You bet!"  Cecilia
lifted them reverently.  There were three
dozens of them.  Her years were such that
numbers and prices still counted.
</p>

<p>
"Who shall I tell <i>her</i> they're from?" asked
Annie.  "Yuh got her goat, yuh know."
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan," answered Cecilia.
Suddenly the guilt of the other lie, her shame
over the act unthinkable, and her new realisation
of the standing of those she loved, slid
from her soul.  She was wildly happy.  She
hugged Annie.
</p>

<p>
The white furniture didn't glitter coldly.
It smiled.  A crowded flat was far away.  The
trees in a smug park were beautiful.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"One new frock," read Father McGowan,
"twenty-five dollars.  Hat, fifteen.  'Madam
Girard's skin food, and wrinkle remover,' two
dollars and fifty cents.  Flat-heeled shoes,
seven dollars.  Taxi, one dollar and fifty-two
cents.  Church offering, ten cents."
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan threw back his head, and
laughed loudly.  Jeremiah Madden looked on
him, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"It's her cash account, yuh know.  Twenty-five
dollars fer one dress," he mused, with a
pleased smile.  "<i>Ain't</i> she learnin' quick?  But
the letter," he added, with a perplexed frown
appearing, "it sounds <i>too</i> happy.  The happiness
is a little <i>too</i> thick.  Smells like she put it
on with a paint brush jest fer show."
</p>

<p>
"Hum&mdash;&mdash;" grunted Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
He opened a pink letter sheet.  At the top
of it a daisy was engraved.  "I give her that
paper," said Jeremiah proudly.  "She <i>was</i>
tickled.  She sez as how none of the girls in
school had nothing like it."
</p>

<p>
"I believe it," replied Father McGowan.
There were heavy lines in his face.  Cecilia's
heart-ache lay on his shoulders, he felt, for he
had made the "Brick King."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Darling Papa:" read Father McGowan,
"I was so happy to hear from you.  I read your
letters over and over.  I love you very much.
I am learning that that is the biggest thing in
the world, loving people, and having them love
you.  I miss you, but of course I am happy.
</p>

<p>
"The School is elegant very nice, and I get
enough to eat.  The view from the front
windows is swell beautiful.  It looks right out on
the Park, all over fancy foliage and rich people
walking around.  I sometimes walk there,
and one little girl, awfully cute, with bare legs
and a nurse, likes me.  Yesterday she threw a
kiss to me.  She looked like Johnny when he
was little, and we lived in the flat.  It made
me want to cry.
</p>

<p>
"I am very happy.  You do so much for me.
I will be very happy when I can come home to
you and Johnny, and we can have Father
McGowan to supper dinner every Saturday night.
I am sending some things that look like fruit
knives, but which are butter spreaders, and are
used to apply butter to bread, etc. (i.e., not to
eat off of).
</p>

<p>
"I am very happy.  I went to one party in
an exclusive girl's room.  It was kind of her
to ask me.  I love you so much, Papa.  Please
kiss Johnny for me, and Norah.  Tell her to
use the butter spreaders daily.  (<i>All</i> the time.)
</p>

<p>
"She need not cherish the blue glass butter
dish any more.
</p>

<p>
"I do love you, dear Papa.  Your,
<br />
"CECILIA."
</p>

<p>
"P.S.: I send my respectful regards to
Father McGowan, and thanks for getting me
into this exclusive School, which caters only
to sophisticated people with money.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"C."
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
"Well?" asked Jeremiah, after Father
McGowan had laid down a pink sheet of paper
with an engraved daisy at the top.  "Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Hum," grunted Father McGowan,
"Hum!"  He stared long at a brick which lay
on the top shelf of a gilt cabinet.  "I'm going
up to Boston," he said at length.  "I'll look
in on our little Cecilia."
</p>

<p>
"Will yuh, now?" asked Jeremiah.  "It's
kept me awake nights, thinkin' that mebbe in
spite of all the expense, she wasn't happy.  I
wanted to go up, but Johnny sez I wasn't
suitable fer a girls' school, being as I remove
my collar absent-minded like (having always
did it)."
</p>

<p>
"You're suitable, all right," said Father
McGowan, "but since I am going up, I might as
well attend to it.  Hard for you to leave
business, too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," admitted Jeremiah happily.  He
swelled and cast a loving eye toward the brick.
Then he wilted.  The proud pleasure was gone.
"<i>She</i> always wanted a bunnit with pink roses
on," he said in a low voice, "an' I couldn't never
buy her none, an' now&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan laid a hand on Jeremiah's.
"There, there, Jerry!" he said.  "Think how
happy you're making the children!"
</p>

<p>
A sallow boy came in.  He cast a sneering
look at a limp figure in a gilt chair.  Then,
without a word, he picked up a book and went
out.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah's eyes were like a child's&mdash;the eyes
of a frightened child.  "Sometimes," he said
in a whisper, "I'm afraid he's <i>ashamed</i> of me!"
</p>

<p>
"No!" exploded Father McGowan, "No!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There is nothing like the scorn of the
undetected guilty for those who are exposed.
Cecilia was treated to fine scorn, supercilious
looks, and, worst of all, a chill overlooking; for
she had allowed a boy whom she'd never met
to buy her a soda water and a pink sundae!
And,&mdash;what made the offence doubly revolting?&mdash;was
the fact that the boy was considered
by the girls a man, and that those who had
seen him termed him "<i>Ravishing</i>, my dear!"  He,&mdash;but
let us quote: "Simply <i>Rav</i>ishing, my
dear, with dark eyes and hair.  <i>Hon</i>estly, he
looked as if he had a secret sorrow, or was on
the stage, or was <i>fear</i>fully fast.  Something
wonderfully interesting about him, you know.
Why he would <i>ever</i> look at <i>her</i>, I can't
see,&mdash;&mdash;" etc.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia sat in the corner of the shabby-impressive
room.  She was reading "Sordello"
because it was required by the English teacher.
Cecilia wasn't a bit interested, and twice the
book had slipped shut, and she hadn't known
at all where she'd left off, which was
annoying; she was afraid she might read one page
twice, and she couldn't bear the idea of that.
She wondered if this Browning person could
have made a success at manufacturing bricks?
She judged not.  He didn't seem practical, but
inwardly she was sure that he could have done
anything better than write poetry.  She really
wondered quite a little bit about him, but after
the laughter of the class on her question: "Is
Mr. Browning an American or does he come
from the Old Country?" she had ceased to
voice her speculations.
</p>

<p>
She turned the pages fretfully.  There were
a great many more.  She hoped that Mr. Browning
was dead, so that he wouldn't write
any more stuff that they would be required
to read.  Then she berated herself soundly
for this unholy wish.
</p>

<p>
Annette Twombly and a girl with tawny
hair and green eyes came in.  When they saw
Cecilia they raised their eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"There seems to be <i>no</i> privacy in this place!"
said Annette.  Cecilia turned a page.
</p>

<p>
"And what is worse, my dear," answered the
green-eyed, "one is constantly called upon to
meet persons socially inferior&mdash;the kind
suitable to the kitchen and associating with the
policeman."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had turned another page, but she
had not read it.  The print was jumping
dangerously from the quick pump of her heart.
"I will not move," she thought.  "I will not
move, nor show them that I hear."
</p>

<p>
"Imagine allowing an unknown man to buy
you sodas!" said Annette, who was looking out
of the window.  "Isn't it utterly <i>hope</i>less?"
</p>

<p>
There was a pained silence.  The hopelessness
of it had evidently eaten deeply into the
systems of Annette and the green-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"Milk, an' sugar, if yuh have it," mimicked
the green-eyed.  She scored her point.
Cecilia's book closed.  She got up quickly and
went toward the door.  There she paused with
her hand on the jamb.  "I hope it pleases you
to make me so unhappy," she said quietly, "for
otherwise I don't know what you are
accomplishing."  Then she went upstairs to an
always lonely room.  She closed the door gently
and lay across the bed, staring at the ceiling.
She never cried any more.  She reached
beneath the pillow.  Her cold and moist little
hand closed about the letter of a brick king.
</p>

<p>
"I love you!" she whispered fiercely.  "I
shall make you proud of me, but Maw, I'm
glad you died before the roses came!  I'm glad!
I'm glad! ... They have so <i>many</i> thorns!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The young ladies downstairs didn't giggle
as usual.  They avoided each other's eyes.  At
last Annette said, "Upstart!  How dared she
speak to me that way!"  It was said in an
effort to reinstate her superior right to
exercise the rack.  The green-eyed didn't answer.
She looked out of the window.  At last she
said carelessly, "Going to dress."  And
Annette was not invited to her room.
</p>

<p>
The green-eyed stood still just inside her
door.  She thought of a fat father, and of his
code of morals.  The mother whom her eyes
came from was very distant.
</p>

<p>
"It has been utterly devilish!" she said
loudly.  "Utterly.  And I did it while I read
'The Mob,' and ranted over it."  Then she
threw a book across the room, which spelled
emotional crisis for her temperament and, this
time, reform.  Her green eyes were full of
healthily ashamed tears.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
A HINT OF PINK
</h3>

<p>
Cecilia sat well forward in the parquet seats
of an opera house in Boston.  Her small hand
was curled up in the fat palm of a fat priest.
The people who saw this smiled indulgently,
then looked again; for the little girl was so
pretty, and so happy, and the man's face was
unusual.
</p>

<p>
The curtain had not gone up.  They were a
good fifteen minutes early.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Father McGowan-dear," said
Cecilia, "it was not just their fault, for I am
so different.  I am still, but less so....
Then one day they said more than usual while
I was reading that Sordello poem.  (It isn't
interesting, is it?)"  Father McGowan smiled
and shook his head.  "And I thought I just
couldn't stand it.  I was so miserable that I
even thought of taking the veil!"  Father
McGowan laughed suddenly.  Cecilia looked at
him with questioning eyes.  "Go on, dear,"
he said gently, "and excuse a bad-mannered
old priest."
</p>

<p>
She squeezed his thumb and continued:
"Well, it was that day I decided to go home.
I decided I could not be a lady, I mean I could
not acquire a <i>savoir faire</i> (that means a
natural swellness)," explained Cecilia.  Father
McGowan nodded.  His eyes twinkled.  "So,"
said Cecilia, "I took all my money, and put on
my hat and sneaked out.  Then I walked down
the block and across the Park.  I saw a baby
in the Park, a little girl, and she makes me
think of Johnny when he was little and I took
care of him.  Then I thought of maw, and
how she wanted me learned, I mean taught,
and I went back.  I am not very brave, and I
wanted to cry dreadfully.  I got in the hall,
and there was Mrs. De Pui.  She looked awfully
cold, and she said, 'May I ask where you
have been, Cecilia?' and then, that green-eyed
girl I hated broke right in and said, 'I had a
slight headache, and I asked her to post a
letter for me, Mrs. De Pui.  I <i>hope</i> you don't
mind.'  The green-eyed girl is very rich, and
so Mrs. De Pui said so sweetly that she hadn't
minded at all.
</p>

<p>
"She always says 'post' instead of 'mail,'
Father McGowan-dear.  She spent two weeks
in London last summer, and she said that the
English accent became unconscious, or at least
that she used it unconsciously.  And she does
except when she gets excited or talks fast.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she followed me upstairs, the green-eyed
one, her name is Marjory, and I said, 'I
do thank you.'  Then I felt mean about the
way I'd felt toward her, and I added, 'I am
very sorry that I have hated you so.'  Then she
kissed me, Father McGowan-dear.  Really,
she did, and she said she was <i>glad</i> I'd hated
her.  That it helped.  She went down the hall,
and paused at the turn to say, 'It is a great deal
to ask, but some day I hope you'll like
me!'  Oh,&mdash;the curtain's going up!  Look at
that yellow dress.  Aren't her legs <i>beautiful</i>?
Mine are <i>so</i> skinny!"
</p>

<p>
There was a burst of music, and the chorus
waved their arms with the regularity of the
twist of aspen leaves, when rain is coming.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia gasped.  Then she sat breathless,
watching every motion on the stage.  A fat
priest sat looking down at her.  Once he took
off his glasses and polished them.  Something
was making them misty.
</p>

<p>
The curtain went down.  Cecilia gasped
again, then she told of the awful, humiliating
sick-cat episode, and of her disgrace in
accepting a "choclut soda," and a pink sundae
with whipped cream on top.  Father McGowan
was very understanding.  He did not think
it was a sin.  In fact he was quite violently
sure it was not.  He grew very red in the face.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with that woman?" he
asked in an entirely new, and really horribly
stern tone.  Cecilia didn't answer.  Her
startled eyes recalled him.  "By George!" he said.
"I forgot the candy!" and he produced from
a coat pocket the most beautiful box.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oh</i>," said Cecilia, "oh!"  She smiled up
into Father McGowan's face, and then added,
"I can put that ribbon in a chemise.  Oh, dear
Father McGowan!"
</p>

<p>
"What is a priest to do," asked Father McGowan,
"when all his inclinations are to kiss
a young lady's hand?"
</p>

<p>
"I am so happy!" said Cecilia.  Father
McGowan put his other hand on the small one that
lay in his.  Cecilia tightened her little fingers
about his thumb.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
Father McGowan pushed away his plate.
The chops were underdone, the potatoes soggy.
</p>

<p>
"Here's yer coffee," said Mrs. Fry.  She
was a perfect person for the housekeeper of a
priest, being so visited with warts and a lemon
expression that questioning her morals was
impossible.  Father McGowan stirred the
coffee, then took a sip.  He sighed.  "Well,",
he thought, "at least it makes fasting easier!"
</p>

<p>
In the hall of the rectory were twelve
people.  They were all shabby, and a boy of
eleven sniffed with a wonderful regularity.
They were all waiting to see a fat priest.  A
girl with sullen eyes and once pretty face
looked around with defiant assurance.
Opposite her on the wall hung a carved wood
crucifix.  When her eyes met that, she shrank, and
then she'd look away, and again be sullenly
brazen.
</p>

<p>
A well-dressed man rang the bell.  The
warted housekeeper answered it.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see Father McGowan,"
he said.  "I will only need a few moments of
his time," he added on seeing the people waiting.
</p>

<p>
"Set down," ordered Mrs. Fry.  "You'll
have to wait yer turn."  The man smiled.  He
was faintly amused.  "I hardly think so," he
said; "I am Doctor Van Dorn.  My time is
rather valuable.  I can hardly waste it in
that way."
</p>

<p>
"It's his rule," said Mrs. Fry, nodding her
head toward the rear of the hall.  "All who
waits is the same.  Yuh waits yer turn, or yuh
goes.  <i>He</i> don't care."  She had fixed her eyes
above the man's head with all her words.  He
looked on her, frowning deeply, then said with
an unconcealed irritation showing in his voice:
"Will you at least take him my card?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fry nodded.  She held out a palm
that looked damp, then went down the hall,
reading the card as she walked.  "He needn't
be so smart," she made mental comment.
"<i>Here</i> he ain't no better than none of the
rest."  She went toward the table at which
Father McGowan sat and shoved the card
toward him.  "He wants to see yuh right off,
<i>now</i>," she said.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan picked up the card, read
it, and then laid it aside.  "Tell him the rules,"
he said shortly.  He turned back to a page
of pink letter paper, with a daisy engraved on
its top.  He glanced from it to the clock.
He still had twenty minutes before work began.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Dearest Father McGowan, dear:" was
written on the pink sheet.  It was crossed out
and below it was written, "Respected Father:&mdash;(I
meant the first, but I suppose this is
properer.)  I can't tell you how happy you made me
by the play and everything.  I have put the
pink ribbon in a chemise where it looks decorative,
and cheers me up, as I like pink ribbons in
underwear, although white are better taste.
I am much happier.  I am not <i>always</i> happy,
but do not tell Papa, nor any one that I am
not.  I <i>am</i> much happier than I was.
</p>

<p>
"I apologise for clinging to you and kissing
your hand good-bye when you left, but I am
not sorry.  It was very hard to let you go.
Pink roses seemed <i>all</i> thorns just then."
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan stopped reading.  He
looked across the room with far eyes.  They
were surrounded by fat wrinkles, and made
small by thick lenses, but they were rather
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to do as you suggested and try
another school," he read, "but I somehow feel
that I must finish what I've started, and I
would like to show these girls that my soul
is not purple silk trimmed with green velvet,
if you can understand that; they seem to judge
everything by rhinestone hair-pins, which is
not a real clue to character.
</p>

<p>
"When you go to dinner with Papa, see that
Norah uses the butter spreaders, which are
small knives shaped like fruit knives.  I will
be deeply grateful.  They are used for buttering
bread, and so on (not to eat from).
</p>

<p>
"We are studying art.  Andrea Dalsartoe,
who painted the Madona of the Chair, just
now.  Marjory is so kind to me.  She is an
Episcopal but nice in every other way.  They
say a prayer to themselves when they go into
church, too.  She says, 'Peanuts, popcorn, and
chewing gum, amen,' which I do not think is
<i>very</i> devout.  She says it is just the right
length when said <i>slowly</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You did make me so happy by that play
and the candy.  I have never had a better time
but once, after which I was disgraced and
sorry.  (I had not met him socially, you know,
which made it improper to eat sundaes with
him, even while on an errand of mercy to a
sick and dying cat.)
</p>

<p>
"We hear an orchestra every Saturday,
chaperoned by our English teacher, who has
asthma horribly and splutters a great deal.
The music is classical and improving.  I do
not enjoy it very much, but there is a man in
the orchestra who has an Adam's apple that
wiggles and he helps me.  One can always
find enjoyment when looking for it, can't one?
He plays a horn, and blows the spit from it
often.  He seems to have a great deal of spit.
</p>

<p>
"I have not thanked you the way I wanted
to for the play, and everything, not forgetting
the taxi ride and the sundae afterward.  I do
love you, Father McGowan, dear.  I believe
if there were more priests who believed in
God, <i>and</i> pink boxes of candy, there would be
more Christians.
</p>

<p>
"Most respectfully, and lovingly,<br />
  "CECILIA."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The clock struck one.  Father McGowan
folded up a pink sheet, and put it, in its
envelope, in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
He was smiling gently.  He opened the door
into the hall, and the people struggled tiredly
to their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Pax Tibi!" he said with a hand above his
head.  A girl with sullen eyes sobbed aloud.
A Doctor sneered.
</p>

<p>
Much later the Doctor was admitted to a
rather bare room, made tolerable by the
colours of the books which lined its walls.  The
priest sat behind a table.  They exchanged
the usual formalities, then Father McGowan
said: "Well?" Doctor Van Dorn shifted
uneasily.  "It is difficult to explain," he said.
"I don't know just how to put it, but I thought
you, if any one, could help me."
</p>

<p>
"I shall do all in my power to help you, if
I think you need help," answered Father
McGowan.  The Doctor picked up a paper knife.
He toyed with it, then blurted out: "I feel
sure that there must be some reason for it, and
that he's merely doing it from some evil wish."
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Doing what?" asked Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
The Doctor looked silly and laughed
uneasily.  "I'm not very coherent," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," said Father McGowan, "we're
both doctors in a way.  We both meet that
enough to understand it.  Now take your time
and tell me your story in your own way."  He
pushed a box of cigars across the table.  "Want
to smoke?" he asked with the move.  The Doctor
nodded and lit a cigar.
</p>

<p>
"It concerns a man named Madden," he
said, "who, I have found, is one of your people.
I have no proof, at least of the tangible
sort, but I believe he is doing all he can to
ruin me....  He is succeeding fairly well,
too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said Father McGowan.  "Now
what's he doing?"
</p>

<p>
"It began," said the Doctor, "with my hospital,
which you know is a private affair, and
in which some of my fellow doctors, with me,
do some experimental work.  The most of
my clientele consists of the rather more
well-known people of this city, as you know."
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan nodded.  The Doctor's
voice was as usual, and he began to swell a
bit, with the tale of his hospital and its
clientele.
</p>

<p>
"I rarely take charity work," said the
Doctor.  "All New York is after me...."
Suddenly his face changed.  "Was after me," he
corrected.  He studied the end of his cigar.
"I did take one small chap," he went on slowly,
"a charity case.  He interested me.  The
complications were most unusual; however, you
would not understand about them, and they
do not influence the tale.  I took him in and
gave him the best of care, even to giving him
a hundred-dollar room and an especial nurse.
(His case was most interesting.)  Well, as
you know, the action of the muscles and
organs is changed by anesthesia.  I&mdash;ah,&mdash;I did
but the slightest experimental work, keeping
him well-fed, you know, and in this
hundred-dollar-a-week room.  The best of care, as I
explained.  He,&mdash;ah,&mdash;himself submitted to
this slight pain when I told him that after it
he would run and play as other boys.  He had
a natural, childish desire to run and play.
Quite natural, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," said Father McGowan.  His
tone was dry.  His expression was very different
from that which he had worn while reading
the pink letter sheet.
</p>

<p>
"Then one day when a slight,&mdash;very slight,
I assure you,&mdash;operation was absolutely necessary
to his getting well, he said he would not,
could not endure it.  He had been quite
weakened by his being in bed, and so on, but he
screamed wildly.  What he said was most
improper and very ungrateful.  He turned
against us suddenly, as is the way of some when
diseased."  The Doctor stopped.  He had
grown rather white.  He was again in a
hundred-dollar room, which had a slat door, and
no way to keep the voice of a frenzied charity
patient from the rest of his aristocratic
hospital.  He heard the voice again: "Gawd, no,
youse devils! ... Youse are killing me!
Lemme die!  Oh, Mister, don't strap me down!
I can't stand it no more.... Don't&mdash;don't!  Christ
...  Christ ... Kill me, but
don't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Doctor moistened his lips, and came
back to the bare room in St. Mary's Rectory.
"He was most ungrateful," he said to Father
McGowan, "and he bit my hand when I tried
to silence him."  Father McGowan was
looking out of the window.  The Doctor went on
less surely.  "A woman who scrubbed the floors
heard this, and, as is the way with her class,
got emotionally aroused.  It seems she lived
in a tenement, and had lived there when
Jeremiah Madden had lived across the hall, before
he made his money.  She went to see him.  He
removed the lad from my care, and with his
malicious help, lied viciously about me and my
work, scattering statements broadcast, and
giving their statements to the papers.  My own
profession do not largely back me up, being,
I suppose, jealous, and of little spirit.  I think
they recognise my skill too well to love me.
You read those articles?" he asked, turning
to Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"That has nothing to do with your
narrative," answered Father McGowan.  "Please
go on."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the Doctor, his well-bred voice
holding a hint of frost, "it,&mdash;that is, this
malicious attack,&mdash;had prejudiced many.  For the
good of this Madden man's soul you should
help him to be truthful, not to so belittle his
nature by&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're worried about his soul?" said Father
McGowan.  "Is <i>that</i> why you came to me?"  Father
McGowan smiled.  The Doctor shifted
in his chair.  There was the staccato tap of
crutches on the bare floor of the hall.  The
knob of the door turned.
</p>

<p>
"Father," came in a small boy's voice from
the doorway, "I brung yuh a toad.  I want
youse to bless it.  It's dead.  It was a cripple,
too.  I found it all mashed.  You'll bless it?
Me an' the fellers is going to bury it.  <i>Ain't</i>
it cute?"
</p>

<p>
The Doctor had not turned.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, little Saint Sebastian," said
Father McGowan.  The little boy gave him a
look that was pathetically adoring.  His
crutches tapped across the bare floor.
Opposite the Doctor, he looked at him.  Suddenly
he screamed.
</p>

<p>
"Gawd!  My Gawd!  Oh, Father
McGowan,&mdash;<i>don't</i>&mdash;let him have me!"  He clung to
Father McGowan's cassock as he sobbed out
his broken prayer.  "Don't, Mister, don't!"
he ended weakly.  Father McGowan picked
him up.  He looked at the Doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Go," he said.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan again settled back of a
bare table.  A little boy sobbed in his arms.
"Will you forgive me, little Saint Sebastian?"
asked Father McGowan.  The child's arms
tightened around his neck.  Father McGowan
coughed.
</p>

<p>
"We're going to have some pink ice cream,"
he said after an interval.  "Now here's my
hanky.  Gentlemen don't wipe their noses on
their sleeves!"
</p>

<p>
"Will&mdash;will yuh bless the toad?" asked the
child, after a damp smearing of Father
McGowan's handkerchief.  "He was a cripple.
<i>Ain't</i> he cute, now?" he added in a tender,
little voice.  Then he brightened and said loudly,
"But I'm glad he's dead, for they ain't no
Father McGowan toads to be good to little
toad-cripples!"
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan coughed, and tightened
his arms about Sebastiano Santo of the slums.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dearest Paw&mdash;I mean Papa!" said
Cecilia.  She clung to him.  The lights of the
New York station blurred through her tears.
Then she veered away from him, and gathered
Johnny close.
</p>

<p>
"Aw," he said, "cut it!  There's one of the
fellows over there."  But "one of the fellows"
faced the other direction, Johnny saw, and he
allowed himself to hug Celie quickly.  He
was glad to see her, but he felt a vague
resentment toward her because her coming made
his throat so stuffy.  He remembered the
time when he used to sit on her lap and eat
bread spread thickly with molasses.  He didn't
know quite why he was thinking of it in the
Pennsylvania Station....  He remembered
that he used to pull her curls and that she'd
pretend to cry and then kiss him, and then
they'd both laugh, and laugh.  It was always
a great joke.  And then she'd look at the
clock and fry potatoes and meat over a smelly
stove, and say, "Now laugh!  Paw's coming
home.  He needs all our laughs!"
</p>

<p>
"John dear!" said Cecilia.  Johnny forgot
the past, and swelled.  Cecilia's use of his name
made him feel a man.
</p>

<p>
"Mister, will yuh please attend to this here
baggage?" he heard his father say.
</p>

<p>
"Don't call him 'Mister,'" he corrected
Jeremiah in an undertone.  Cecilia stepped
from them to a group nearby.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Marjory," John heard her say.
"Yes, I <i>will</i> come to see you.  You'll come to
my house, too?"  She turned to a rather
more cool looking young person, and added
less surely, "I would love to have you, too,
Miss Annette, if you'd care to come."
</p>

<p>
"I'm rather busy&mdash;&mdash;" John heard the
Annette person reply.  Then he saw her turn
away from Cecilia.  His heart grew hot.  "If
I don't see you again," said Cecilia, "I wish
you the happiest kind of a Christmas!"  Annette
did not reply.  The Marjory girl kissed
Cecilia twice.  "Good-bye, little Saint," she
called after Cecilia.  "I'm coming to see you
to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
In the motor there was a pause for inspection.
"Yuh look so different," said Jeremiah
rather wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"My heart is just the same," said Cecilia.
"It will always be the same."  She kissed
Jeremiah Madden after her words and then leaned
forward and kissed Johnny.  He didn't mind,
none of the fellows being present.  Then they
were silent, for when hearts are very full they
are liable to wiggle up into throats and choke
people when they try to talk.  At last they
were out of the crowded streets and on broad
ones, where other cars, taking people
pleasure-bent, rolled past them.
</p>

<p>
Then the house.  The house from which
Cecilia had gone last September, wearing a
suit all over buttons, with a touch of "tasty"
red here and there.
</p>

<p>
"Norah, darling Norah!" said Cecilia.
Norah's red arms drew her close, then, quite
in Norah's way, she eclipsed behind a
blue-checked apron, and sobbed loudly.  Cecilia
looked about the hall.  There was some new
furniture.  A hat-rack that was evidently the
work of a lunatic with the unrestrained use of
a jig-saw.
</p>

<p>
"Look up, Celie!" ordered Jeremiah.
Cecilia looked up.  Strung across the hall was an
elaborate electric sign.  The words were made
of blue, yellow and red globes.  She read:
"Welcome to our Darling!!!"  Cecilia gasped.
Then she turned to her father.  "It is
beautiful," she said, "and just what I
wanted."  She stopped and swallowed with difficulty.
Then added, "Papa dear, I love you so!"  Johnny
smiled.  He raised his eyebrows and
his shoulders.  Then he sniffed.  He thought
he smelled the scent of roses.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
SANTA CLAUS
</h3>

<p>
Father McGowan, holding a cassock high
about his black-clad legs, stood in the back
yard of the rectory grounds.  The back yard
looked like those photographs entitled, "Rude
shelters for the soldiers," or "Huts built by
the South Australian Light Horse Brigade."
</p>

<p>
All over the brown lawn were small shacks.
Some of them made of brick, some of old and
weather-beaten boards, and some of these two
with a smattering of very ex and sticky
roofing mixed in.  Father McGowan smiled.
Mrs. Fry looked out of the window.  Her lips
tightened.
</p>

<p>
A small boy emerged from one of these
affairs.  Emerged on his stomach, wiggling out.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan," he yelled, "we got a
secret passage!"
</p>

<p>
"No!" said Father McGowan enthusiastically, "No!"
</p>

<p>
Another door opened.  Another boy came
wiggling forth.  "<i>We</i> got a secret place to
hide things in, in ours!" he said in a sing-song,
mine-is-better-than-yours tone.
</p>

<p>
"Aw&mdash;&mdash;!" said the first disparagingly.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan laughed.  A boy came
swaggering across the lawn.  He whistled, "In
My Harem."  He touched his hat to the priest.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to get a case of pop," he said
loudly, "an' drink it here.  Mom, she gimme a
candle, and Pop sez I can stay out 'til nine."  After
this he was instantly the centre of an
awed and admiring group.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fry opened the door.  "The 'phone
wants yuh," she said shortly to Father
McGowan.  Father McGowan went in with
evident reluctance.  He wanted to hear more of
the case of pop, which he knew would narrow
down to two bottles.
</p>

<p>
After he'd passed through the kitchen, Mrs. Fry
spoke again to her sister who sat steaming
by the stove.  "<i>He's</i> like that," she said, a
great love, yet vast contempt, showing in her
tone.  "He lets all the kids around build
shacks in the backyard, and even gets 'em stuff
to build with!"
</p>

<p>
"What fer?" asked the steaming one.  Her
bewilderment was complete.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Mrs. Fry, "he sez something
about its bein' necessary to a boy's soul to
build something and tear it down.  An'
pretend things that ain't.  One day they calls
that mess of rubbish the wilds of Sieberia, an'
the next an Indian camp.  An' <i>he</i>, he gets right
out an' chases around with 'em.  He's busted
his glasses twice this month."  Mrs. Fry sighed.
"I kicks," she went on, "and then he sez,
'Mrs. Fry, I'm sorry, but the fact is, an aunt
brought me up, awfully good woman, too, but
too neat.  I never pounded, and a boy needs
to pound.'  Then he sez, 'Now if there is
anything you need for the kitchen that I can get
you, Mrs. Fry, I'd be glad to.'  An' what can
I do?  I lead an awful life because of them
young rapscallions, but <i>he</i> can't see it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be beat!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fry poured out a cup of coffee and
pushed it toward her guest.  "Ain't sugar
high?" she said as she dumped in two lumps.
</p>

<p>
"You bet," answered her guest.  "Does <i>he</i>
set and study much?" she questioned.  <i>He</i>
was very interesting.  Mrs. Fry drew a long
breath.  "He don't get no time to set," she
answered.  "He hardly has a chance to eat
half the time besides being pestered by them
kids.  I never know when he'll be on time for
meals.  Did I tell yuh about the bath-tub?"
she questioned.
</p>

<p>
The steaming shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"<i>It has two ally-gaters in it!</i>" said Mrs. Fry
with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"My Gawd!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, one of these here kids got 'em sent
him from Florida, or some furrin port, an' his
mother, being a sensible woman, wouldn't have
'em near.  Well, the kid comes bawlin' to
Father McGowan (they always do), an' he
sez, 'Now, Jimmy, don't cry.  You can put
'em in my bath-tub; I only bathe once a day,
and I can use a tin one.  Mrs. Fry has her own
bath-tub on the third floor, so she won't care.'  I
did, but what kin yuh do?  I sez, 'I won't
enter that room with them rep<i>tiles</i> in it fer to
clean it.'  He sez, troubled like, 'Well, Mrs. Fry,
I'll do it, or get one of the boys to.  I
don't mind.'  Them kids messing around there.
Can yuh see the way <i>they'd</i> clean it!"
</p>

<p>
"Ain't that fierce?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, an' he don't care so much fer it, either.
He sez he <i>could</i> hope they'd die or summer'd
come.  (We're going to have a pond in the
backyard&mdash;to run into the cellar!)  Yuh
oughta see that room after he's bathed in that
there tin tub.  All that's missin' is Noah and
Shem&mdash;we got the animiles."
</p>

<p>
There was the click of crutches in the dining
room.  The door opened.  A small boy appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, dearie," said Mrs. Fry.  Her tone
was softened.
</p>

<p>
"What's his name?" asked the visitor.
</p>

<p>
"He don't know," answered Mrs. Fry.
"He was in the hospital one time, real sick,
and lately he don't remember so good.  'Father
McGowan calls him 'Sebastiano.'  Want a
cooky, dearie?"  The boy nodded, and smiled.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Cecilia had had her friend Marjory to lunch.
It had gone rather well.  She recalled it as
she stood looking out of a heavily glassed
window into a frosted street.  She, herself, had
set the table.  The napkins had not been set
up in tumblers.  The fibroid tumor vase was
quite absent.  There had been valley lilies in
a flat bowl for the centrepiece....  She had
disposed of the blue glass butter dish by dropping
it.  Cecilia felt strangely sad as she did it.
The blue glass butter dish had once seemed
so very lovely....  "Are they giving me
anything to take your place?" she questioned, as
it shattered on the floor.  Then she called
Norah, and listened to her laments as she
gathered up the pieces.  She had the feeling of
untruth added to her little sadness.
</p>

<p>
As yet nothing had taken the place of blue
glass butter dishes for small Cecilia.  She still
preferred rhinestone hair-pins, and French-heeled
shoes to their plainer sisters.  Beauty
had been taken away and none substituted, at
least none that she enjoyed.  The only thing
she really cared for was the dragging of her
newly acquired French in her talk.  She did
this often with the proud feeling that it was
what her mother had wished.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah had said, on meeting Marjory,
"Pleased to meet yuh, mam," and Cecilia had
broken in with, "I love papa so much,
Marjory, you must too."  She had hardly known
why she had made this defiant and sudden
declaration.  Johnny had been much impressed
with Cecilia's guest.  So much so that his
misery was acute when Jeremiah related the
incident of the brick throwing.
</p>

<p>
"I sez to him, 'Yuh can lay yer own bricks
an' here's one to begin with!'" Jeremiah had
said with his customary chuckle, that chuckle
that always came with his proud remembrance.
</p>

<p>
"I think that was exceedingly clever of you,
Mr. Madden," Marjory had replied.  Cecilia
had smiled on Marjory with the smile of an
angel, she had also laid her hand on her
father's.  Johnny had squirmed.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia gazed out of the window.  The air
looked cold.  She wondered whether she would
ever get the chance to thank that Mr. Keefer
Stuyvesant Twombly for those lovely flowers?
They had come just at the right time.  He was
wonderful, as the girls said, and "ravishing,"
but better, he was nice.  There was a scuffle
at the door, Norah's voice was heard: "Now
mind the <i>eee</i>-lectric sign!" she said sharply.
Cecilia knew that the tree was coming in.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Late that evening Jeremiah opened the door
of the pink and gold "parlour."
</p>

<p>
"Santa Claus has been here and went," he
said mysteriously to Cecilia and Johnny, who
sat on the stairs, "an' he's did good by yuh!"
</p>

<p>
"Now remember!" said Cecilia to Johnny,
with a stern look.  Johnny had been told that
his disbelief in Santa Claus was not to be
expressed.  They scrambled up.  Cecilia stopped
in the door.  The tree was a mass of silver and
glittering lights.  It was really very lovely.
Mr. Madden's tastes were well suited to trimming
a Christmas tree.
</p>

<p>
"Showy like, an' nothing cheap or old lookin'!"
he said, as he surveyed it with proud eyes.
Cecilia went toward a table on which her gifts
were spread out.  First, she saw a phonograph
with a morning glory horn....  By it was a
pink velvet box, strapped in silver.  "Jewels,"
was written in a neat, spencerian engraving
on one spot of the silver banding.  There was
a mother of pearl brush and comb and glass,
bound in wiggly gold.
</p>

<p>
"They are lovely, Papa!" said Cecilia.
"And <i>just</i> what I wanted!"
</p>

<p>
"Looka here!" whispered Jeremiah.  He
pulled her toward the light the tree threw and
took from his pocket a small box.  He
opened it slowly.  Cecilia saw a chain and
pendant that would have made a very good
showing on the Christmas tree itself.  It was
plainly built for one of the rhinoceros family.
It had seemed to dislike showing any partiality
in gems.  There was a fair smattering of all
jewels present.
</p>

<p>
"Three hunderd dollars!" breathed Jeremiah
Madden.  His eyes shone, and he breathed
quickly.  "Celie," he said, "it ain't too good
fer yuh!  There ain't nothing I wouldn't do
fer yuh!"
</p>

<p>
"I know, dear," answered the small Cecilia,
"but you shouldn't.  It is too much.  You have
made me very happy."  She turned away.
There was a sudden smarting beneath her
eyelids....  She hated the school that had taught
her a quiet manner, and to see blue glass butter
dishes as a visitation rather than a glory.
</p>

<p>
"That ain't <i>all</i>!" said Jeremiah.  He took
hold of her arm, and led her to the other side
of the room.  "Throw on the lights, Johnny!"
he called loudly.  Cecilia felt him tremble.
The lights snapped on with a too white glare.
Jeremiah and Cecilia stood before a picture
over which was thrown a cloth.  Jeremiah drew
it aside.
</p>

<p>
"It was did from a tintype," said Jeremiah
softly.  He looked on the face of his Irish
wife.  Her lips were painted a brazen carmine.
Her cheeks glowed like the stage ladies' of the
billboards.  Around her neck were three ropes
of huge pearls.
</p>

<p>
"He threw in the pearls," explained Jeremiah
in a voice that shook a little, "an' fancied
her up some, but them eyes,&mdash;it's your maw,
Celie.  Your maw that died in a two-room
flat."  With the last words Jeremiah had
turned away.  His shoulders had a limp droop.
The happiness of the evening had faded.
</p>

<p>
"What's in this box?" asked Cecilia,
unsteadily.  It was a hat box and stood beneath
the new portrait.
</p>

<p>
"Her present," answered Jeremiah.  "The
present I give her.  Look at it, Celie.  Ain't
it pretty?  I picked it."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia opened the box.  She drew out a
large, flopping hat.  It was trimmed with pink
roses.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next day when Father McGowan was
all ready to start for the Madden house, there
was commotion in the wilds of <i>Sie</i>beria.  It
had been reported the day before that one of
the "guys" had smoked a Piedmont, and
Father McGowan, finding this so, had had to
dust him mildly with a hickory cane, hung on
the back porch for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
He disliked doing this, and smoked for a
good hour afterward to soothe his nerves.
Mrs. Fry had watched the chastising with pleased
eyes, but then, on going to the bathroom, all
happiness had vanished, for one of them
rep<i>tiles</i> had crawled out of the tub.  She had
dropped her scrubbing cloths, and disappeared
screaming.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan had been all ready to start.
He had found his hat (which had the most
mysterious way of disappearing), and with an
ashamed expression, he'd put a small box in
his pocket.
</p>

<p>
Then the wilds of <i>Sie</i>beria had demanded
attention.
</p>

<p>
"Them young devils," Mrs. Fry had said,
with a bob of her head backward.  "They are
raising Cain!  Something's wrong."  She went
off muttering.  She still cherished and resented
the encounter with the rep<i>tile</i>.  Father
McGowan went toward <i>Sie</i>beria.  It was one of
the few times in his life that he hadn't wanted
to.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Now</i> what?" he called from the back porch.
A scream was the only answer.  It came from
one of the brick dwellings.  The chastised of
yesterday, Father McGowan saw going
quickly over the fence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, drat!" said Father McGowan.  There
were wilder howls from the brick mansion.
Father McGowan went toward it.  He looked
for the door, then he chuckled softly, for the
door was entirely gone.  He took off his gloves
and began to pull out the bricks.
</p>

<p>
"Walled in," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Lemme out!  Lemme out!" came from
within, in muffled tones.  Then with the
opening Father McGowan had made, and with the
advent of light, the screams dissolved into
pathetic sobs.
</p>

<p>
"When I git him!" came in moist tones.  A
small boy wiggled out.  He had a paper
covered book in his hands.  "He done it,"
explained the boy, between sniffs, "while I was
a-readin' in the secret chamber.  <i>He</i> done it.
When I git him!  I'll smash him!  I mighta
starved!" he ended pathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Father McGowan, "that is
a shame!  Won't you come have a piece of
pie now?  You must be hungry."
</p>

<p>
The boy nodded.  He followed Father
McGowan toward the house.  "He done it," he
went on, "because I told on him fer smoking.
I thought I <i>oughta</i>."  The sufferer's tone was
pious.  "My nerves is shook up," he said when
they reached the porch.  "I was afraid I'd
starve.  There's pictures in our physiologies
of starving Cubans&mdash;they ain't so nice.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Fry," said Father McGowan, "we
do need a piece of pie.  Could you find us
some?"  Mrs. Fry muttered and went to the
refrigerator.  Out on the back fence the
chastised called, "Yi!  Yi!"  A note expressing
scorn.  He added, "Cry baby!  Cry baby!"  The
cry baby turned and exhibited a piece of
pie.  The chastised relaxed into a pained
silence.
</p>

<p>
"Come here!" called Father McGowan.  The
boy slid from the fence and came slinking
toward him.  "Mrs. Fry saw you smoking," said
Father McGowan.  "I never listen to what you
tell of each other.  Here's a piece of pie for
you."  He looked at his watch and added in a
perfunctory way, "You shouldn't have walled
him in."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I ought to have given you a Rosary," said
Father McGowan.  He still looked guilty, but
happily so.  Cecilia stood before a mirror,
looking at a dainty little chain and pendant,
which she'd clasped about her throat.
</p>

<p>
"I know you ought, Father McGowan,
dear," she answered, "but I'm <i>so</i> glad you
didn't!  It's <i>so</i> beautiful!"
</p>

<p>
She gasped happily.  Father McGowan
smiled.  "Papa gave me one," she said.  "It&mdash;it
is, that is, I love it, but I'll wear this
more."  She looked into Father McGowan's
understanding eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I am learning," she said, "but I learned
things before I went to school that I shall
never forget, and that I never want to forget."
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah came in.
</p>

<p>
"You give her that?" he asked in a pleased
voice.  "Well!  But have you saw the one I
give her?  <i>Three</i> hunderd dollars!  Get it,
Celie, and then play us 'The Shepherd
Boy.'"  Celie vanished.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
White-clad nurses flitted about the halls of
Jeremiah Madden's house.  There was a dead
silence, and upstairs that druggy-sick smell.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had been very ill.  She was better,
but still sick enough to keep Jeremiah anxious.
He hovered about the house almost forgetting
bricks, and wearing a collar all the time, as he
did on Sundays.  It had begun with a cold,
then a cough, which (through Celia's standing
on the curb, better to view a gentleman down
the street who was interestingly drunk) had
turned to pneumonia on both sides.
</p>

<p>
She had gone to bed protesting that she felt
very well, but that her breath was not acting
quite right.  Then she had grown so very, very
sick that she had forgotten time, life and even
Jeremiah of the bricks.
</p>

<p>
Those days had been rather dreadful for
Jeremiah....  He had taken to sitting just
outside her door on a very upright chair.  He
turned the pages of "Ridpath's History of the
World."  He was trying to "educate himself
up to Celie." ... However, he missed a great
many of the pictures and only got as far as
Volume One.
</p>

<p>
Each time a trim nurse would step from
Cecilia's door, he would cough to get his voice
in shape, and then whisper gratingly:
"Excuse me, Missis, but how is she?"
</p>

<p>
"She is doing well," the white one would
answer, in a tone of thin sincerity.  Then
Jeremiah would go back to Ridpath, miserable, and
unconvinced.  Once in a while he would hear
Cecilia's high, little voice&mdash;"Keefer, the
butler!" she repeated again and again one day.
She said it in gasps, but somehow got out the
words.  The effort in her voice had cut
Jeremiah's heart, but the words had brought a
proud smile.
</p>

<p>
"Associatin' with butlers!" he whispered.
"<i>Ain't</i> she gettin' fine?"
</p>

<p>
Then Cecilia moaned of butter dishes, blue
ones.  Jeremiah had left his post and Ridpath's
History long enough to go shopping.  He
bought her three butter dishes.  Two of them
had covers.  The third boasted of a curling
handle, on which perched a dove and a cupid,
on a spray of something that looked like
spinach in the crude state.  Cecilia had been
very pleased with them.  She had looked on
them, said, "T-thank you, <i>dearest</i>!" and then
cried gently, the tears slipping down her face
with pathetic regularity.  She cried all that
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not good enough for you!" she gasped,
"but I love you, and butter dishes!"

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
A LITTLE TOUCH OF THE MAN WITH THE HOUR GLASS
</h3>

<p>
Time had been careful with Father
McGowan.  Perhaps he thought Father McGowan
rather nice as he was, and unneedful of the
lines that usually come with heart and soul
expansion.  Be this as it may, the fact was
that he was little changed.  The lenses in his
glasses were a bit thicker.  He had accumulated
a little more tummy in the last seven
years, but he still played Indian and exile in
<i>Sie</i>beria with the same joy, and he was still
the true father to every child who knew him.
</p>

<p>
He sat behind a bare table in a room unbeautiful
except for the books which lined its walls.
He was looking over his mail.  He laid one
letter with a foreign postmark aside.
</p>

<p>
There was a tap on the door.  A small boy
of nine, or thereabout, came in, sobbing wildly.
"My mom, she sez you're a <i>Catholic</i>!" he
gasped between sobs.  "Yuh ain't, are yuh?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid so," answered Father McGowan.
He looked very guilty.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" replied the small boy, and
sobbed more loudly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, now!" said Father McGowan.  "We
can't <i>all</i> be Methodists, you know.  The church
wouldn't hold 'em.".  The child still sobbed.
"I'll tell you," went on Father McGowan;
"you pray that we'll all belong to one church
in Heaven.  You do that.  Wouldn't that
be nice?"
</p>

<p>
"Uh huh," agreed the boy with tempered
enthusiasm.  He smeared his tears across his
face with his coat sleeve.  They left white
streaks.  "I couldn't <i>believe</i> you was a
Catholic!" he said sadly.  "You're so nice, and
because of the pie and all."  His face was long
and his eyes melancholy.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Father McGowan, "so
sorry.  How's Siberia to-day?"  The child
reported and then vanished to do his utmost in
making a convert by prayer.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan opened the rest of his
mail, and then reached toward the letter of
foreign stamp.  He always kept the best 'til
last.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Dearest Father McGowan-dear:&mdash;" it
began in a hand characteristic of many boarding
schools, and yet showing a bit of individuality&mdash;"I
have wanted to write you....  So many
things to do that half the time all I get
accomplished is my loving of you dear people, every
day a little more, though more seems impossible.
I love you, and Papa and John so much.
So much that when I'm away from you, and
think of you, I feel quite choked.  It is rather
beautiful, and terrible, this caring so deeply.
I do not know how I could ever say good-bye."
</p>

<p>
There was a page of Cecilia's large scrawl.
It contained no news, but Father McGowan
read it closely.  His eyes were the same as
when, years before, he had looked on a table
Cecilia had decorated in honour of a big, fat,
Roman priest.  Suddenly he laughed.  "We
have a small donkey," he had read, "whom we
have named Clara, after the vicar's sister.
Our donkey has long ears and a religious
expression, too.  The vicar's sister is really very
nice, but our grey donkey looks so like her that
we always expect her to stop in the middle of
the road and talk of missionary barrels and
Sunday School treats.  The latter is a form
of entertainment which contains much jam, tea,
many pop-eyed little girls and boys, not to
omit a large stickiness.  (I went to one, and
poured tea down Lord Somebody's neck.  It
was a great condescension for him to 'stop in,'
and only the fact that I am of 'mad America'
saved me from a public hanging.)
</p>

<p>
"Marjory and I have splendid times.  I am
so glad I am with her.  It is nice for me, and
I think for her.  Mamma Aliston is one of
those poor ladies who enjoys suffering.  If she
had lived where I did in my younger days,
she would have said: 'I ain't feelin' so well.
The doctor's give me three kinds of medicine.
It's me <i>nerves</i>.'  As this is not in order, she
mutters of draughts, and places a pudgy and
diamond-ringed hand above her heart many
times a day, sighing expressively.  Marjory
has no sympathy with her.  She only says,
'Don't eat that, Mamma; it is bad for you,'
about anything Mamma enjoys.  I am a beautiful
buffer.  (Please pardon the 'beautiful';
it refers to spirit.)
</p>

<p>
"The way those two people clash is utterly
dreadful.  I remember always, when I hear
them, Saturday nights, years ago, when the
gentlemen of our building used to tumble
upstairs, very drunk, and I would then hear
squawks and abuses.  We are all the same,
but people never realise it....  I laugh inside
when they talk of 'lower classes.'  I laugh but
sometimes it hurts a little.  I am ashamed,
Father McGowan, that it should....  Coming
home very soon.  I want to give a man named
Jeremiah Madden as many years of happiness
as I can.  I am coming home to play 'The
Shepherd Boy' every evening after a lemon
pie-ed dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan-dear, I have been
worried about John....  Here I see so many
heavy-eyed boys slinking into manhood.  Those
boys who travel with their blindly indulgent
mammas and leave a man at home, alone,
across the seas.
</p>

<p>
"I think if my little brother should grow up
to be viciously weak, I could not bear it.  I
cannot see how he could, for the blood in us is too
plain for fancy wickedness.  Rather ours would
run to fierce encounter, and, if we must be
truthful, flying dish-pans.  But,&mdash;well, I've
dreamed of him too often lately, and I remember
that he may be stepping into manhood.  I
wish I were better fitted to be wise with him....
I have not liked his letters, Father
McGowan.  His estimate of people is made in
the shadow of a dollar mark...."  Father
McGowan read another page.  On the last was
written: "So, I will see you very soon, dear
(excuse the liberty, but you <i>are</i> dear!), and
I am ready to take up my burdens.  Those
that come with money.  I hope to do much and
learn to do it well.  You will help me?
</p>

<p>
"I shall leave Marjory and her mother in
this sleepy little village, shadowed by its
Cathedral.  The cross that has stood for peace
through many years shines from its spire and
seems to bring it here.  It is so lovely, Father
McGowan!
</p>

<p>
"Very much love from your always grateful
and loving
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"CECILIA."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"But, my dear!" said Mamma Aliston, "I
could not <i>permit</i> you to return alone!  Could
not permit it!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," answered Cecilia, "but I must
go.  I have my maid.  I should not be really
alone."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like the look of it," said Mrs. Aliston
fretfully.  Then, "<i>Is</i> Clara going to sleep!
Why you girls <i>insist</i> on having her when you
could motor smoothly with a footstool and
cushions and all the windows closed,&mdash;Oh!
My heart!"  Cecilia turned a sympathetic eye
toward Mrs. Aliston.  "It is nothing, my dear,"
said Mrs. Aliston in answer to her look,
"nothing to one who is <i>used</i> to suffering.  Oh,
dear, what a sorry thing this world is, when we
are poorly equipped to meet it.  Who was that
who passed us?  Not Lady Grenville-Bowers?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia nodded and stopped Clara so that
Mrs. Aliston could feast her eyes on the holy
dust titles were kicking up.  It was not Lady
Grenville-Bowers, but Mrs. Aliston was happily
unconscious of it, and Cecilia had learned
the proper use of lies.  After Mrs. Aliston
again settled she went back to the original
subject.  "Let me see," she said, speculatively;
"perhaps there will be some one crossing to
whom it will be suitable to confide you.  I
dislike so intensely this running about alone,&mdash;my
dear! <i>please</i> watch that beast!  Yes, more
than likely there will be some one.  I know so
many people, many of whom some would feel
privileged to know!  I'll look about.  I dislike
so intensely this idea of your crossing alone.
It is rather, pardon me, dear, common,&mdash;middleclass.
Yes, I'll look about.  No doubt some
one may be found."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia nodded absently.  She had learned
to "yes" and "no" at the proper times with
Mrs. Aliston, quite without a listening
attention.  Strangely, she was thinking of some one
else beside her father, John or Father
McGowan.  This some one who had been the
leading man of her dreams for a great many years.
In fact, ever since she had rescued a sick and
dying tabby.
</p>

<p>
She had carried his true voice with her
wherever she went....  Often when things called
men had asked for her hand because it held
money, a genuine voice had echoed through
the years.
</p>

<p>
"Pussy needs some Mothersills,&mdash;&mdash;" she
would hear, and then with an absurdly little-girl
feel for being so influenced, she would
gently discourage.
</p>

<p>
There had been some who really loved; some
loving with an air of condescension showing
through their manner,&mdash;others truly, and with
humbleness.  Some poor, weak, with only love
as recommendation.  Some just ordinary men,&mdash;one
or two made big by what they felt for
small Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
And with them all, something was wrong.
She heard the echo of a nice boy's voice, as
he bought a small girl a "choclut soda," and a
sundae all-over-whipped-cream, and she heard
it while she said: "No; I'm sorry.  I really
can't.  I'm <i>never</i> going to marry.  I hope you'll
find some one you'll like <i>much</i> more than me!"
</p>

<p>
And they had all said they never would,
which is the way with young men....  Cecilia
had believed the first one, then life had taught
her the quick healing of some hearts, and she
had smiled a little when the rest said it.
</p>

<p>
That smile was always the undoing.  They
usually kissed the hem of her dress, and swore
to shoot themselves, and Cecilia would whisper:
"Oh, <i>please!</i>  Some one will see you!" or,
"Oh, <i>please!</i>  Some one might hear you!"
whichever the case might be.  Then they
always kissed her hand and went away, and
Cecilia would sigh and say, "Well, I suppose
that means an awfully nice wedding present
soon, to show that I'm not put out!"
</p>

<p>
Sometimes she wondered if K. Stuyvesant
Twombly were living, and if so, where?  Then
she often decided <i>not</i> to think of him, because
it was too childish....  And then she would
discover that every life must have its fairy tale,
and that he was hers....  "Home!" said
Mrs. Aliston, with a sigh of relief.  "Oh, my poor
body!  'My little body is a-weary of this world.'  Who
said that, Cecilia?  Bernard Shaw? or
Arnold Bennett?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Cecilia, "I think it's in the
Bible, but I can't just remember."
</p>

<p>
A groom stepped forward to lead Clara
away to her boudoir and dinner.  Cecilia went
into the cool house to write her father on a
small typewriter she carried for that purpose,
Jeremiah being "partial to print."
</p>

<p>
Outside the grey of the English twilight
crept slowly near....  Everything was
peaceful,&mdash;quiet.  America were far away.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The person suitable for Cecilia's chaperon
was found.  She was very correct, had several
chins, and was well connected.  She came from
Boston and mentioned this fact in a hushed
tone.  On talking with her, Cecilia felt as she
had in the first few months of boarding
school&mdash;chilled, and alone.
</p>

<p>
This morning was the one before they sailed.
Miss Hutchinson had wished to go to Westminster
for a last look.  "You will come with
me?" she had asked of Cecilia.  The question
had really been a statement.  Cecilia replied
that she would be charmed to go.  She went
to get a broad hat that entirely eclipsed one
eye.
</p>

<p>
The sun was faintly present.  "It is fine,"
said Miss Hutchinson, who spoke English
whenever she remembered it, to show that she
had lived much abroad.
</p>

<p>
"So it is," said Cecilia.  "How absent-minded
of the sun!"  Miss Hutchinson didn't
answer.  She was busy showing a taxi driver
the error of his ways.
</p>

<p>
"Robbers!" said Miss Hutchinson, as they
settled on the stuffy cushions.  Cecilia looked
after a passing bus, and wistfully.  She dearly
loved to ride on top.  They bumped along,
Miss Hutchinson expatiating on some one's
relatives.  It seemed that one of them had been
"in trade."
</p>

<p>
"Papa makes bricks," said Cecilia calmly,
wondering, as she said it, whether the British
soaked their shoes overnight in the "bath" to
get that delightful muffiny effect and the curl
up at the toes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Miss Hutchinson quickly,
"that is quite different.  His business is on
a large scale, and his fortune excuses
anything.  This man had been in trade in a small
way?&mdash;a sweet-stuff shop, I believe, or a
chemist.  Something fearfully ordinary."
</p>

<p>
"Horrible!" said Cecilia.  Miss Hutchinson
looked at her.  Cecilia's smile was strange.  She
hoped she was not saddled with a young
person of too modern ideas for seven days....
In Westminster Miss Hutchinson went
toward the Poet's Corner.  Cecilia wandered
outside.  She paused by a small stone set in
the wall.  "Jane Lister, Dear Child," she read.
The gentle little ghost smiled on her from
those simple words.  She looked long at them.
She always saw the "Dear Child," quaintly
frocked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Some one paused behind her.  She turned.
"Isn't that almost too beautiful?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered K. Stuyvesant Twombly.
</p>

<p>
He looked on this impulsive, American
girl, and smiled.  Then she turned back to
Jane Lister, and he raised his hat and
went on.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes made his memory itch, but he
could not know why.  Perhaps some one whom
he'd met suggested her.  He met a great many
people....  Uncommonly pretty, if he cared
for beauty,&mdash;or girls.  Then his mind turned
to business interests.  He was supremely
American.
</p>

<p>
The girl in the cloister still gazed at a
weather worn slab.  "Dear child," she said,
"he is alive.  Oh, dear child, isn't that beautiful
too?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
John was faintly smiling.  A superior smile
that was his own and took in no one else.  He
used it often on the "Gov'ner," who from it,
was reduced to a pulp, and realised himself
fit for nothing but supplying funds....
Father McGowan was not reduced to a pulp,
but he was genuinely angry.  He thought with
a longing of a hickory cane which hung on
the back porch of the rectory.
</p>

<p>
"How old are you, John?" asked Father
McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"Eighteen," replied the overgrown boy.
"Gettin' on, yes, gettin' on."  He lounged
back in his chair.  Father McGowan leaned
across the table.
</p>

<p>
"Old enough to take tender care of your
sister when she gets back," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," answered John.  He studied
his finger nails.  They were gorgeous examples
of the manicure's art.  John wished the old
man would get on.  He had a date....  He
wondered what he was driving at anyway?  He
covered a yawn and muttered a pardon....
"Late hours," he added, in explanation.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan again thought of a cane
which hung on the back porch.
</p>

<p>
"How's your father?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh,&mdash;the Gov'ner?" replied John in a tone
of entire surprise.  "Really, I don't know.  I
haven't seen him for a week."  He again
looked at his finger nails then he thought of
a girl he did not meet socially.  His thoughts
and attentions ran to that kind.
</p>

<p>
"What a rotten life a priest's would be!
Staying in a dull room like this&mdash;" he thought,
then became conscious of a long silence.  He
looked up.  Father McGowan's eyes were full
on him....  Space faded.  John was a baby
in a crowded flat.  He cried, and a little,
tired-eyed girl picked him up.  "Aw, Johnny!" she
said.  Flies buzzed about.  The dull hum of
traffic came from the street below.
</p>

<p>
Some one called, "Celie, aw Celie!  Quick!"
from a room off of the kitchen.  The little girl
vanished.  He heard unpleasant sounds, then
moans.
</p>

<p>
John started up.  The chair in which he'd
sat overturned.  "You devil!" he said to a fat
priest.  The dream had faded.  John breathed
in gasps.
</p>

<p>
"I will excuse you," said Father McGowan,
"if you will remember what a sister did for
you, and in return give her the greatest gift:
a pride in the boy she loves.  Good-night,
John."
</p>

<p>
After the boy had gone, Father McGowan
scratched his head, as was his manner when
perplexed.  "What was the matter with him?"
he asked aloud.  Then he sighed.  The talk,
he was afraid, had done little good.  At first
he had gotten only a supercilious smile, and
then that outburst.
</p>

<p>
Well, life was only a succession of tries,
and a climbing at the wall unscalable....
Father McGowan dismissed the problem,
thought of the comfort of a hot bath, and then
the perusing of a new book he'd just bought.
"Oh, drat!" he muttered.  There was a baby
water snake in the tub, and the tin one did
not invite a lingering.  It scratched in several
inconvenient spots.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Outside, John still breathed in gasps.
"Home," he thought as he settled in a low,
grey roadster.  "I don't like her hair anyway,"
he offered in weak excuse for abandoning his
original plan.  Yes, he would be good to
Cecilia.  Awfully good to her....  Had her
life, his,&mdash;ever been as dreadful as that flash?
Cecilia should never know him otherwise
than she believed him.  It would be a noble
deceit, lived for love of her.  That was the
game one played with women that one truly
loved.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The <i>Arcania's</i> decks were alive with people
scurrying hither and thither, seemingly with
no impulse behind their unrest, nor aim in
direction.
</p>

<p>
A few souls stood very calmly by the rail,
watching the steerage embarking.  Their
whole attitudes said, and loudly: "This is all
old to me.  I will have you know it is even a
bore!"  They were looked on with respect by
the few to whom crossing was a novelty.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was pleasantly excited.  Sailing was
not new to her, but she was so healthily alive
that she tingled with any enthusiasm near.
</p>

<p>
"Our deck chairs are in the most absurd
spot!" said Miss Hutchinson.  "I told the
steward what I thought of him, and them.  He
said he would change them.  Aren't you going
to look at your flowers?  Your state room is
full of them.  I stepped in.  Your maid was
putting some of them in your wash bowl.  I
told her that would never do.  You will have
to use it, you know, to brush your teeth, wash,
and so on, and if you're sick&mdash;it is most
inconvenient to have the stand cluttered with
flowers.  I&mdash;ah, happened to notice Lord Ashby's
card on some flowers.  Where did you meet
him, <i>dear</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Sunday school treat," replied Cecilia.  "I
poured tea down his neck."  Her reply was
made in an absent way.  She was scrutinising
the passengers.  There was a fat woman near
who looked lovely!  She stood within earshot
of Cecilia and Cecilia heard her address her
husband as "Poppa," and then a very healthy
and pleasantly loud-looking maiden as
"Lotty."  It made Cecilia feel as if she were
in the warmth of a summer sun, just to hear
them.  So happily natural, they were.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Horrid</i> people!" said Miss Hutchinson
loudly.  She elevated a lorgnette, and looked
"poppa" up and down critically.  "Beer,
Cincinnati," she decided in far-reaching tone.
Cecilia squirmed.
</p>

<p>
"That dear baby in the steerage!" said Cecilia,
to divert the offended Miss Hutchinson.
</p>

<p>
"Dirty!" commented the diverted.  "So
absolutely degrading the way the lower classes
have children!  One after the other!" ended
Miss Hutchinson.  Cecilia did not voice it, but
she wondered what other mode of entrance into
the world was possible, one at a time, rarely
two, having been the style for a good many
years.
</p>

<p>
The baby began to whimper.  Its mother
slapped it vigorously.  Cecilia looked away.
She hated to see a child slapped.  Johnny
had often been most trying.  She had rarely
slapped him....  Then she turned and quite
forgot the hot, whimpering baby of the
steerage....  K. Stuyvesant Twombly stood
behind her.  He recognised the impulsive girl
who had spoken to him at the small tomb
of "Jane Lister, dear child," and he raised
his hat and smiled.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia gasped.  Then, she went below, and
very quickly, to see her flowers.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Oh, but you are nice," said Cecilia, "if your
name is not!"  Then she looked away from
K. Stuyvesant Twombly.  She had not meant
to say anything like that!  It had simply come
out!
</p>

<p>
The wind blew strongly and ruffled her hair.
K. Stuyvesant Twombly watched her with a
good deal of interest.  She was <i>quite</i> different
from any girl he'd ever met....  She watched
first the rough sea which looked like a small
boy's chewing gum, laid in a safe place waiting
for the next chew ... grey, indented with
the marks of small teeth.  Then all the sea
would slip below the rail, and all of the world
would be sky.
</p>

<p>
"I was named," explained K. Stuyvesant,
"Keefer, after a rich uncle.  He died and left
all his money for the support of Lutheran
missions in China.  After that my mother used to
faint every time she'd think of my first name."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia laughed.  "I'm <i>so</i> sorry!" she said.
"Does she still faint over it?"
</p>

<p>
"She died last February," answered
K. Stuyvesant quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry!" said Cecilia again.
K. Stuyvesant didn't answer.  They were quiet
for a few moments, both watching the tilt, and
eclipse of the sky-line.  At last the man spoke.
"It is tragic," he said, "to have the ones you
love die, but it is more tragic to have those
you have loved from instinct, and never known,
die.  You wonder, all the time, whether they
too, are fretting because of the lost
opportunity.  You wonder what there was below that
you didn't see....  All I remember of my
mother was her hurry to get in a great number
of engagements, and a chill aloofness,
cultivated, I have thought since, to keep in check
over-tired nerves....  If we could have once
gone below the surface!  Even with incivilities,
if in that way, we could have known each
other....  Never saw one another, fleeting
glimpses...."
</p>

<p>
"You poor man!" said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ashamed to have said that," he said.
His voice was gruff.  "But,&mdash;it's been in my
heart these long months,&mdash;that endless regret."  He
drew a shaky breath.  Cecilia laid her hand
on his arm.  Without a shade of consciousness
his hand closed around hers.  "I've never told
any one that before," he said.  "You're
awfully&mdash;different.  I feel as if we'd known each
other always."  He turned his head and looked
down at her.  Their eyes met, and it was hard
to look away.
</p>

<p>
"You're so dear!" he blurted out.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia, used to many men of many compliments,
coloured.  She squeezed his hand, and
then shyly drew hers away.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Higgenmeyer came waddling down
the deck.  She saw Cecilia and smiled widely.
"Well, dearie!" she said in her usual carrying
tone, "Lotty was looking fer yuh.  She and
poppa are playing rum now.  She wants you
should see a wireless she had from her
gentleman friend."
</p>

<p>
"I'd love to!" answered Cecilia.  Momma
passed by.  K. Stuyvesant and Cecilia laughed
gently.
</p>

<p>
"I like to love and laugh," said Cecilia; "but
if you leave the love out, the laughter is too
liable to turn sour."
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant nodded, but he hadn't heard
what she said.  He was undergoing new and
terrifyingly beautiful sensations.
</p>

<p>
"The Higgenmeyers are dear, aren't they?"
said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Um hum," answered K. Stuyvesant.  He
turned quite boldly and stared at her, while
she looked out upon the sea and sky.  He
wondered, while he swallowed hard, whether he had
any chance.  He wished he weren't such a
duffer!  He even wished faintly that she
weren't so wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia looked up at him again, and again
the warm colour came into her cheeks.  Then
she began to talk quickly of a recent play.
Her voice was not quite steady.  She wouldn't
meet his eyes.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Miss Hutchinson was speaking of a paper
she'd read before the Boston literati on "The
Message of Ibsen."  Cecilia didn't know much
about Ibsen, but she thought he would have
been rather surprised if he'd heard what he
"really meant."
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant was, as usual, with them.
Cecilia and he looked at each other often.  The
new, disconcerting light in his eyes had given
way, and was displaced for the moment by a
mischievous twinkle.  Cecilia was able to look
at him frankly again.
</p>

<p>
Miss Hutchinson arose, untangling from her
steamer blanket like a huge butterfly from a
cocoon.  "My point was," she said loudly,
"that Ibsen is the Seer of those who SEE, but,"
she sighed, "there are so few of us!"
</p>

<p>
She vanished.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia giggled.  "Are you one of <i>us</i>?" she
asked of K. Stuyesant.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, no!" he answered laughing, and then
added seriously, "I'm an awful duffer.  Stupid
and all that.  I never used to care, but now I
do.  You&mdash;you don't read that kind of stuff,
do you?"  His appeal held a great fear.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" answered Cecilia.  "I stopped
reading improving things after I left school,
I can't bear them, and it depresses me so to
use my head!  I'm not a bit clever."  She
sighed with her last words.  They were both
making many confessions about their failings.
Somehow it seemed necessary.  Also, they both
wished a great deal of the time that they were
much nicer!
</p>

<p>
"You know what Stephen Leacock said
about intellectual honesty?" asked Cecilia.
K. Stuyvesant shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I can't quote," said Cecilia, "but he said
as you grew old you would find books had
brought you more pleasure than anything
except tobacco.  But then, he said, you must be
honest about them, reading only what you
liked.  That if 'Pippa Passes' didn't appeal,
you should let 'Pippa' pass, that she was not
for you.  There was some more, but I shan't
ruin it by misquoting it.  It was so clever!"
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant didn't answer.  Because
Cecilia was afraid of his silences, she began to
tell him of a small brother whom she greatly
loved.
</p>

<p>
"But you'll know him," she ended, "if you
come to see us.  You will, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, rather!" answered K. Stuyvesant.
"Why, you <i>know</i> I'm coming!"  There was
almost a resentment in his voice.  "Cecilia,"
he said, with his first use of her first name, "I
haven't any right, but you're so <i>dear</i>, I have
to.  Have I <i>any</i> chance?"  He leaned very
close above her steamer chair.  He had gotten
quite white.  "Cecilia?" he whispered in question.
He reached for her hand, then drew back
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I know you meet lots of fellows much finer
than I am," he went on, "and when I'm away
from you I don't see how I have the nerve to
hope, but I can't help it.  Cecilia&mdash;dear?"
The "dear" was rather muffled.  K. Stuyvesant
had never used it before and it stuck, even
though he wanted so much to say it!
</p>

<p>
She turned her face toward him, and he
could say no more.
</p>

<p>
She thought of a brick on the top shelf of
a gilt cabinet.  "Nothing could matter to him,"
she thought; "he is so dear, but I must
see..."
</p>

<p>
"When we get home," she whispered, "after
two months you may ask me again, if you're
sure."
</p>

<p>
"Sure?" he echoed.  "Sure?  Oh, <i>heavens!</i>"  Then
he looked down at her for quite a few
rather breathless moments.
</p>

<p>
After that they talked.  "After two months,"
repeated Cecilia stubbornly.  It made no
impression.  At last she equivocated a bit and
gained her point.  "I hardly know you," she
said, looking away from him; "I&mdash;I prefer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about girls," said
K. Stuyvesant, "but I know I've been a dub.
I'll try to be agreeable, I'll <i>try</i> to keep this to
myself.  But,&mdash;you <i>will</i> give me a chance?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia said she would.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh,&mdash;I love&mdash;&mdash;" began K. Stuyvesant;
then he shook his head.  Cecilia didn't mean
to, but she slipped her hand in his, under the
kind shelter of a blue and green checked
blanket.  K. Stuyvesant didn't say anything
more.  He only looked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Higgenmeyer came paddling by.
</p>

<p>
"Poppa ain't so well," she called.  "He's sick
to his stummick!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm&mdash;I'm sorry," answered Cecilia.  She
tried to pull her hand from K. Stuyvesant's.
He refused to let it go.  After
Mrs. Higgenmeyer had passed, he spoke.  "You're
mine!" he said in the manner of all lovers.
"You are!"  His voice was gruff.  Cecilia was
to learn that that meant that she mattered
much.
</p>

<p>
At his words Cecilia's heart turned over, but
she remembered her eccentric, dear, and
much-loved father, and a certain brick.
</p>

<p>
"You promised," she reminded him.  "I said
after two months, when I knew you.  You
promised."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be good," he answered dismally, "but I
know you, and it's hard to think of waiting.
There isn't any question of time.  You're
just&mdash;&mdash;, well, I'm thirty-two.  I'd never
dreamed that I could feel this.  I want to kneel
when I think of you.  I&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia drew a deep breath.  They looked
at each other, and the world ceased for them.
They were only a chord stretched to breaking,&mdash;a
chord for Heaven's tunes.
</p>

CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
HOME
</h3>

<p>
"I tell Celie, it ain't like we couldn't buy
'em perfect.  (I could pay for 'em whole.)  But
she sez that ain't it."
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah Madden surveyed a Greek Venus
as he spoke, whose arms were quite lacking.
"As fer me," he went on, "I like 'em with all
their limbs with 'em,&mdash;tasty and neat.  This
here kind of thing makes me think of the War.
There's one in the Eyetalian garden I'm going
to buy a cork leg for."
</p>

<p>
The young men who surrounded Jeremiah
Madden laughed loudly.  The loudness of
their laughter made Jeremiah a bit suspicious
at first, but he reasoned they would hardly
accept his hospitality and laugh at him,&mdash;it must
be with him.  So, vastly pleased and beaming
widely, he went on with pleased pride: "This
here garden cost me near a million, fixings and
all.  That fountain to the right (the one with
the dinky bird settin' on the female's arm)
cost me&mdash;&mdash;" but he didn't finish, for Johnny
came around the corner of a path and emerged
from its boxwood protection with a cough, and
then a loud inanity.  He frowned on Jeremiah
and the laughter of the young men stopped.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know <i>you</i> were here," he said coolly
to the quaking Jeremiah.  Jeremiah realised
that he had displeased, and began unsurely,
"I'll be gettin' back to work.  I just left fer a
few minutes, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come on," broke in Johnny, and the group
of tired-looking youths followed him, leaving
Jeremiah confiding to the stone "female" of his
work and of how he must get back to it.
Realising himself alone, he swallowed his words,
and watched the group disappear toward the
tennis courts with a puzzled hurt in his face....
A half a mile away, and well below, the
waters of the Sound shone brazen blue in the
sunlight.  Sometimes a gull swooped low, and
its wings were silver.  In one spot a marble
wall with a Greek relief stood out in blazing
white against the distant water....  Jeremiah
saw all the loveliness, but he could not
feel it.
</p>

<p>
"That wall cost me&mdash;&mdash;" he muttered, and
then stopped, hearing footsteps.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia stepped from the same path from
which Johnny had made his entrance.  Her hat
was a broad one, hiding her face provokingly,
her dress one of those "simple" affairs, so
dangerous to hearts and purses.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest!" she called rather breathlessly, "I
did so want to see you!  I've been hunting for
you everywhere!"  Jeremiah put his arms
around her and forgot his worry about a certain
son, and even forgot the cost of things.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he questioned gently.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she repeated after him, "I just
wanted to see you."  She fidgetted as she had
at seven, when the request for a new skillet or
pan had been necessary.  Jeremiah understood,
and looked down at the simple affair,
talking of it, to give her time.  "That dress
now," he said, "ain't it kind of plain?  Don't
you like 'em fancied up with ruffles and lace
and stuff?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia said that perhaps it was plain, but
that she rather liked it.  However, she would
get one all-over ruffles for Jeremiah's dear
gaze.  After that they were silent, Cecilia
staring absently out over the deep, blue Sound.
</p>

<p>
"Papa, dear," she said at last, with a gulp.
"There's a man coming out to see me,&mdash;I mean
us,&mdash;for Sunday.  I hope you'll like him.
He&mdash;he's really nice.  I hope you'll like
him."  She stopped for a moment and then again said:
"I <i>do</i> hope you'll like him."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to like him?" asked Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Cecilia, "I do!"  She was
again looking toward the Sound.  Her small,
white teeth were set on her lower lip.  "He's
very dear," she said at last; then she plaited a
pink-edged handkerchief.  Jeremiah frowned.
"There ain't a man fit fer yuh!" he said crossly,
"not a one!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is," answered Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't!" contradicted Jeremiah.
"Does he play tennis?" he questioned, "and set
around in white pants?"  Jeremiah's voice had
grown absolutely fierce.  Cecilia laughed.  "I
suppose he does," she admitted, "but he works,
really hard.  He told me that life had only
meant work for him, until&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hum!" grunted Jeremiah.  "Hum!  Let
me catch him trying to keep company with
you!  White tennis, and pants, and gulfing
around with them funny sticks!  <i>Lemme</i> catch
him!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't get so excited!" said Cecilia between
little giggles.  "He may not even want me.
He really hasn't asked me yet."
</p>

<p>
"He ain't?" exploded Jeremiah.  "He ain't?
<i>Why</i> not?  Is the durn fool blind?  I'd like
to know why not."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia sank to a white marble seat.  She was
laughing helplessly.  Suddenly she sobered
and wiped her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Dear," she said, "do you think I'd love you
less, for&mdash;for loving some one else?  Didn't
you love the whole world more because of
mamma?  It only makes me want to be much
nicer, and want to hug the earth!"
</p>

<p>
She covered her face as she finished, with
slender, little hands.  Jeremiah sat down by
her.
</p>

<p>
"I want my bonnet with pink roses on it!"
she whispered, "I <i>do</i> want it!"  He put his
arms around her because he couldn't answer.
A gull with silver wings swooped low.  Cecilia
uncovered her face, and kissed the brick king.
"Which is my very prettiest dress?" she asked.
"I want to wear it Saturday afternoon."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She tried to think her depression came from
the night before, but half of it came from the
letter which she held in her hand.  She had had
the strangest sinking sensation on reading it,
and she <i>did</i> love Marjory.  Why it had made
her feel that way was a mystery.
</p>

<br />
THE DINNER HAD BEEN WHAT SHE WANTED
</p>

<p>
She opened the letter again.  Its pages
crackled, and sprung into their first folds as
she laid them on the table.  The third sheet she
picked up and read: "Mamma is really quite
wild about travelling with the Johnstons and
I am absurdly relieved.  Being with that dear
lady tells on my disposition (usually perfect,
you know, dear!), and I am happy to say a
dutifully depressed good-bye to the water
bottles and ailments which are all I know of my
progenitor.  I told her I would come to you
for the summer months, and then perhaps go
to Cousin Alice.  I may go home, but I'm not
sure, and such a course involves the proper
dowager, who is always too proper, or too
improper, and ever a bore!  I shall write you
again about all this, and when I shall arrive.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, I shall so enjoy being with you.
You are the only good person I know who does
not offend me.  Perhaps because you are so
unconscious of that quality.  Your influence
is wonderful with me....  How do you like
being an 'Influence'?  I have turned flippant,
but you know I was serious&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And that letter, in some strange way, had
depressed Cecilia.  She had wanted the summer
to be a quiet one,&mdash;one in which she could
learn to know a small brother, have ample time
to amuse her father,&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Well, she was utterly ashamed, but she'd
wanted it alone.  It was so little of her to wish
it so.  Marjory had been so good to her.
But,&mdash;Cecilia had dreamed of quiet evenings
with the moon making a glittering path of
silver on the Sound....  She'd dreamed of a
big, gruff man coming toward her across soft
grass....  That, and the scent of roses, pink
roses....  Instead the summer would be full
of Marjory's friends.  Marjory had so many
and such gay ones!  Dancing, playing cards,
motoring,&mdash;hunting pleasure with a strained
intensity, running foolishly so that boredom
should not overtake them....  And she had
needed the summer with John.  Marjory, her
good friend, was not the one to show him things
as Cecilia would have him see them.  Cecilia
sighed.
</p>

<p>
Then a little spasm of pain flickered across
her face.  The night before was in her mind,
when John, with the friends who were visiting
him, had grown too joyous.  She had heard
them come in in the deep night.  The sounds
had rung clear in the still air.
</p>

<p>
The cars they drove had come crashing
through rose bushes, knocking down slender
trellises....  With silly laughter, she had
heard the men come toward the house.  There
had been unpleasant words said loudly, as if
such utterances were humorous.  There had
been more silly laughter after them.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had felt quite sick.  She had covered
her eyes and made requests of some one's else
mother....  Then she had slipped into a
negligee and cautiously opened her door.
</p>

<p>
The hall was empty and she went to John's
room.  She shook as she travelled the long
hall, and she hated John's friends with a
marvellous hate for one so sweet-natured.  She
was heart-sick and afraid.  John's room was
empty.
</p>

<p>
She stood there a moment, steadying herself.
There were pictures scattered about the room,
which made her understand things more fully.
One, on a table near her, showed a pert miss,
with tightly curled hair, and a dress of cheap
fanciness.
</p>

<p>
"Your own little girl," was written across
its corner, and then the little girl's name,
"Fanchette LeMain."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia turned away.  She went out into the
hall.  She felt as she had years ago when John
was her baby.  At the top of the broad and
long stairs she looked down.  John was on the
first step, sprawled unbeautifully, his head
hanging limp on his chest, his hands closed
around a cerise scarf on which glittered little
silver spots.
</p>

<p>
She looked about to see that no one else was
there and then ran quickly down the stairs.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I'm too heavy," said John, halfway up the
stairs.  He had been considerably sobered by
black coffee, and more so by the sight of
Cecilia.  He leaned on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"I have carried you before," answered
Cecilia.  "When we lived in the flat, that was.
I used to think that when you grew up I could
lean on you.  It was funny how I planned."
</p>

<p>
John didn't answer.  They had reached his
room and he sank to his bed and sat, blinking
stupidly, on the edge of it.  Cecilia slipped to
her knees, and began to take off his shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" he ordered sharply.  "Ring for
Higgens."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather not," answered Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"It was the heat&mdash;&mdash;" he began.  Cecilia sat
back on her little heels.  She looked like a
small girl saying her "Now I lay me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was not the heat," answered Cecilia.
"When you were small I washed your mouth
out with brown soap for doing that.  Now do
you want a drink?  I'll wet this towel; you'd
better put it on your head.  There's the dawn,"
she said, looking toward the window.  Then
she turned and picked up a cerise scarf with
silver spots on it.  She folded it and laid it on
the table by the photograph of Fanchette
LeMain.  John looked unhappy.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia put her hand on her brother's shoulder.
"Good-night, dear," she said.  A quiver
ran across his face.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want you to know," he whispered
"You're so dear, but old-fashioned.  You don't
understand how a man&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped, and
she slipped down on the bed by him.  "Everything's
so beastly here.  I'm so ashamed to
have the fellows see dad," he went on
incoherently.  "Always talkin' of how things
cost&mdash;always makin' breaks in grammar,&mdash;afraid
of his own butler&mdash;&mdash;"  John's eyelids were
drooping.  He fell back, asleep.  Cecilia got
up and tried to pull him into a more comfortable
position.  Then she went to her own room.
On the way she passed Jeremiah's.  She paused
by his door.  She wanted to kiss him,&mdash;as she
had Johnny, when, very small, he had bumped
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse him, Dearest," she whispered.
"He's very young.  Some day he'll understand,
I hope."  Then she went on.  The dawn
had come.  The Sound was covered by a grey
fog.  Cecilia lay down to stare up at her
ceiling.  She did not sleep again.
</p>

<p>
At last came noises.  The gardeners talked
as they worked on the terrace below her
windows.  "Cut up rough," said one.  Cecilia
could hear the break of wood.  The white
trellis with its pink rambler had evidently
suffered.
</p>

<p>
"The old man&mdash;&mdash;!" said another voice
expressively.  They laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the kid's a gent, anyway," said the
other, loudly.  "Drunk every night, and
enough lady friends for a Hippodrome
chorus&mdash;&mdash;" they laughed again.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia turned and hid her face in the
pillow.  Her palms were wet.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan was surrounded by brigands.
Their burnt cork moustaches gave them
a fierce expression terrible to view.
</p>

<p>
"So you saw a man climbing up the grape
arbor?" questioned Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
The spokesman wriggled a little, and then
said, "Well, we didn't just see him but we
heard him."
</p>

<p>
"I seen him," said the youngest brigand,
whose lower lip was quivering.  "I seen him.
He had eyes like fire.  I want&mdash;my maw!
I'm scared!"  The youngest brigand dissolved
into tears.  They ran down his cheeks and
through his Kaiser Wilhelm of burnt cork,
leaving a grey trail on his small chin.  "I want
my maw!" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"An' las' night I seen a man down the
alley.  He sez 'Hello Bub.'  That fierce I ran
home, <i>I</i> tell yuh!" said another of the group.
</p>

<p>
"Bet it was Jack, the Hugger," came in an
ominous tone from the background.  The
brigands quaked.  Their eyes had grown large with
excitement, and fear was plain above the
moustaches.  One small boy who wore a horse-hair
imperial, muttered of "gettin' home to study
his gogerfy."  He, and all the rest, cast
longing eyes toward the door.  The youngest
mopped the tears and smeared his moustache
across his face with his coat sleeve.
</p>

<p>
The fat priest got up and laid aside his pipe
with reluctance.  "Come on," he said; "we'll
go find the villain.  Come on!"
</p>

<p>
Two small boys clung to his cassock,&mdash;the
rest pretended a bravado.  They swaggered
largely through the kitchen, where Mrs. Fry,
washing the rectory dishes, glared at their
intrusion.  Outside the soft dark covered the
fears of the brigands.  Father McGowan
went toward the arbour.  He looked well on the
frail structure, and then shook it.  A black cat
hissed, and jumped down.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> wasn't scared none!" said the brigand
who had wanted his maw, "<i>I</i> was just
pretending!"  The rest of the brigands giggled
foolishly and muttered of "Foolin'."
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan tactfully spoke of the
weather, and then he suggested going down to
the corner drug store, where pink sodas could
be bought for five cents.  There was a flattering
acceptance of his offer.  They started off,
all talking loudly to him of their large
achievements.  He listened and answered just at the
right time, and said just the right thing.  So
they faded into the night, the long, black
shadow with the smaller ones about it, clinging
to it.
</p>

<p>
"He's takin' 'em to the drug store, I bet,"
said a lanky boy who was smoking in the
shadows.  His voice was sad.
</p>

<p>
"He must say lots of Masses," said his
companion.  "Every time them kids bawl around
his place they get something to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Um hum," agreed the first speaker, "but he
ain't no soft guy.  Sometimes he licks 'em fit
to kill."
</p>

<p>
Down the street the drug store screen door
slapped shut smartly.
</p>

<p>
"Them five-cent sodas ain't no good anyway!"
said the lanky boy.  "<i>I</i> wouldn't want
none!" the other sighed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"No," said Mrs. Fry, "he ain't here.  He's
went to the drug store with a mess of kids.
Yuh can set, or yuh can go.  <i>He</i> don't care.
That's the kind of a man <i>he</i> is."
</p>

<p>
The man who stood on the Rectory porch
said he would wait.  As he stepped across the
threshold Mrs. Fry recognised him as a doctor
who had been uppish and sent in his card, "like
he was a King."  She looked critically at his
boots.  "Trackin' in dust all the time&mdash;&mdash;" she
muttered.  Then she went heavily down the
hall, slamming the dining-room door after her.
</p>

<p>
"<i>He</i> never gets no rest!" she stated aloud to
a picture of a dead duck, hanging by its feet.
"Never no peace nor no time to smoke!"  She
glared at the fowl which had been given Father
McGowan by Agnes O'Raddle, as she soliloquised.
The erstwhile Mr. Fry, who had always
been forced to smoke in the backyard,
was far away.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well?" questioned Father McGowan.  The
doctor who sat across the table from him
leaned forward and began to speak quickly,
his breath coming between his quick words in
gasps: "My wife's people had the controlling
interest in this plant, and I put all my money
in it.  It had always paid well.  A ventilator,
it is, which slips beneath a raised window,&mdash;simple
affair, yet good.  Then this Madden
man got ahold of an improved article, patented
it, and started a manufactory in the same town,
started it on a large scale,&mdash;advertised
extensively....  Well, we're ruined.  We can't
compete.  He sells below cost.  He can't want
money; he's losing now.  Why does he do it?
We've done everything.  I've offered him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The bell of the telephone which stood on the
desk rang sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon," said Father McGowan, and then,
"Why, Cecilia!"  There was an interval then
the doctor heard him say: "Your prettiest
dress?  Why they're all pretty!  Why?"  There
was a longer interval, then a sharp
"What?" from Father McGowan.  A silence,
and then, "Dear child!  I'll be out
to-morrow!"  Father McGowan hung up the receiver.  His
manner and voice were changed and softened.
</p>

<p>
"The little boy is dead," he said to the
doctor.  "He was happy before he died.  He grew
very young, and forgot a great deal, the little
boy who was in your care, I mean.  Now go
on, tell me more of this.  Will you smoke?"
</p>

<p>
The fat priest pushed a box of cigars toward
the shaking doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I wouldn't do that now&mdash;&mdash;" began the
doctor.  "Something's broken me.  God, I've
suffered!  What's that?" he ended sharply.
There was the tap-tap-tap that sounded like
small crutches on a polished floor.  Father
McGowan looked perplexed.
</p>

<p>
"It must be the vines against the window,"
he said, "but I didn't know it was windy.  Have
you a match?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor nodded, and lit his cigar.  His
hands shook cruelly.
</p>

<p>
"God, I've suffered!" he said hoarsely, "and
I believe this Madden man has caused it all.
My practice and money gone, I&mdash;&mdash;" he
stopped.  "<i>Can't</i> you help me?" he finished.
"<i>Can't</i> you?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Norah," said Cecilia, "which is my prettiest
dress?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno, dearie," replied Norah.  "Yuh
ain't exactly homely in none!  But don't go
thinkin' too much of yer looks.  My maw used
to say, 'Beauty's only skin deep.'  She was a
great one fer them sayin's."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Norah," said Cecilia, "am I&mdash;am I what
you'd call pretty?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends," said Norah, "on whether
yuh like dark or light hair."  She surveyed
Cecilia critically, her lips sternly tight, but
a proud light showing in her eyes.  Since
Cecilia had grown up, the Virgin had undergone
a complete physical transformation for Norah.
If Norah's Virgin had been on earth, she might
easily have been confused with Cecilia
Evangeline Agnes Madden.
</p>

<p>
"How you kin set in them corsets!" said
Norah, anxious to change the subject.  Cecilia
laughed, then turned before a long glass which
stood between windows.  "I wish I hadn't been
educated," said Cecilia.  "I <i>love</i> pink ones,
trimmed all over with roses and lace!"
</p>

<p>
"My maw used to say, 'Handsome is as
handsome does!'" said Norah sternly.
Cecilia's new concern for her looks and clothes
was disquieting to her.  She thought with a
horror of Marjory's salves, and eyebrow
pencils....  Suppose Cecilia!&mdash;Norah shook her
head.
</p>

<p>
A maid came in the room with a froth of
lacy frills falling over her arm.  She disposed
of the froth, then bent above the seated Cecilia,
and began taking the pins from her yellow hair.
It fell loosely, with the soft, slow motion of
waves, about her shoulders and well below her
hips....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tres joli!</i>" said the true worshipper of
beauty, as she always did.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" replied Cecilia, absently, as she
always did.  This was the rite, frowned on by
the jealous Norah.
</p>

<p>
"I mended yer skirt," said Norah crossly.
"It was tore fierce."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, dear," said Cecilia, and then:
"Josephine, which is my most pretty dress?"
</p>

<p>
Norah left, shutting the door with decision.
She muttered of people who talked Eyetalian,
and other Heathen languages.  Then she
decided it was her duty to tell Cecilia of
Josephine's outrageous flirting with Mr. 'Iggens.
After this lofty resolve her face cleared, and
her expression, became pleasant.
</p>

<p>
She passed a heavy-eyed boy in the hall.  In
the early days he had often shed his tears
against her shoulder....  He had found love,
and understanding, exhibited by doughnuts,
and bread spread thickly with brown sugar.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. John&mdash;&mdash;" said Norah timidly as they
were opposite.
</p>

<p>
"Huh?" he responded, with a cool look.
Norah swallowed with a gulp, and went on.
Her heart was heavy.  Her spirit ached.
</p>

<p>
"We give him too many doughnuts," she
said.  Then again her face cleared.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell Celie how they go on!" she reflected.
"Then I guess she won't be so smart!  Winkin'
and carryin' on!"  The dwelling on the iniquities
of Josephine was vastly cheering.  Norah
almost forgot a heavy-eyed and overgrown
boy, who, when little, had sobbed his troubles
out against her thin shoulder, and had turned
to her for soothing sugar cookies.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At the pretty little station, K. Stuyvesant
was met by Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"How'd do?" he said gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" said Cecilia.  She had on
her prettiest dress, but K. Stuyvesant Twombly
didn't notice it.  They disposed of the baggage
question and then he settled, stiff and
conscious, by her side in a small grey car.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty day," said K. Stuyvesant at last.
Then he looked at Cecilia.  "Gosh!  I
love&mdash;&mdash;"  He stopped suddenly and shook
his head.
</p>

<p>
"Wh-what have you been doing since I saw
you?" asked Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Thinking of you," answered K. Stuyvesant
gruffly.  Cecilia didn't answer.  He was afraid
she hadn't liked his telling her the truth, so he
described a futurist exhibition, while horribly
conscious that the quick beating of his heart
made his voice shake.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you came," said Cecilia after the
futurist exhibition had been described.  "I
wanted to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Dear!" said K. Stuyvesant loudly, and
without the least effort.  He sat looking down
on her with a very honest and revealing look,
a look that would have made any one with
the least feeling bet their last cent on him.
</p>

<p>
"Two months," reminded Cecilia....  It
was really too wonderful.  It had to be proved.
If he really cared he would wait two months.
</p>

<p>
"There's the house," she said aloud, "and on
the terrace my dear brother."  The car twisted
between tall gate posts, and the house and
terrace were lost to sight from the shading trees.
A collie dog bounded out from the shrubbery
and barked fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Evangeline!" called Cecilia.  "He is
Norah's," she explained to K. Stuyvesant.
"She named him after me."
</p>

<p>
"Who is Norah?" asked K. Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"She was our 'hired girl,'" answered Cecilia,
"before we ever heard of maids."  K. Stuyvesant
didn't reply.  In a second the car was
by a side entrance.  "John!" called Cecilia to
the languid figure on the terrace.  John
sauntered slowly toward them.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to know you, I'm sure," he said in
his most grown-up and <i>blasé</i> manner.  "Nice
of you to run out to see us.  We get jolly
bored, you know."  After this John turned
toward the house.  There was an old man on
the broad porch, looking wistfully and
undecidedly toward the group.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the Gov'ner!" said John in a tone
indescribable.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy," called Cecilia loudly, "please
come here <i>right</i> away!"  The brick king came
toward them eagerly.  "Pleased to meet yuh,"
he said as he acknowledged the introduction.
K. Stuyvesant spoke kindly of the beauty of
the place.  "It ought to be beautiful!"
answered Jeremiah.  "It cost enough!  Them
there fixings fer the garden," he went on,
"them alone cost&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let me take you to your room," broke in
John.  "Don't you want to get in cooler
things?"  K. Stuyvesant assented and
followed John to the house.  When he reached
the porch he looked back.  Cecilia stood with
her arm through her father's.  She was
looking up at his face.  Her smile was tender.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh!" said K. Stuyvesant, and shook his
head.  Then he drew a long breath and turned
to follow John.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The dinner had been what she wanted,
thought Cecilia.  He had seen <i>everything</i>....
Jeremiah had asked the butler to "spare"
him a piece of bread.  He had also tucked his
napkin in his collar, and then, with a quick
movement, removed it, looking around as he
did so to see if he'd been noticed.
</p>

<p>
John had wiggled and sighed loudly when
bricks had been talked of.  In an effort to gloss
over the crudities he had contributed a "smart
line of talk," far more impossible than any
amount of money mention.
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant had responded politely to
everything and had avoided looking at Cecilia
with a studied effort.  Cecilia had been silent.
She felt it better that she should not appear
in this act.
</p>

<p>
"He come to me, being as I was a man with
money, and I sez&mdash;&mdash;" came to her again in
Jeremiah's cracked voice.
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon?" K. Stuyvesant had said,
having lost it through John's interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Granted," said Jeremiah.  "I sez, he come to
me an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant had been <i>so</i> dear!  Cecilia
stood leaning on the wall with the Greek relief,
as she thought her thoughts....  She looked
on the Sound, which was black in the night,
except for a path of white moonlight.  A path
that quivered silver.  She looked and saw
K. Stuyvesant listening to Jeremiah's talk.  He
<i>had</i> been so dear!  She wondered whether
they'd never finish their smoke and talk, and
whether he'd <i>ever</i> come to her.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma!" she whispered to the soft dark.
A fitful little breeze sprang up, seeming to
answer.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He came across the soft grass slowly.  His
heart knelt to the little Irish girl who sat upon
the white marble wall.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Mr. K. Stuyvesant!" she called
gaily.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," he answered heavily.  He stood,
arms on the wall, a few feet from her, looking
at her boldly in the soft light.  The world was
full of the rhythmic surge of his pulses....
The night air seemed to beat upon him with
the heat of fire, but there was no thought of
touching her.  He was utterly humble before
his shrine.  He wanted, this American man of
1915, to kneel before this little maiden....
He craved the touch of her hands on his head.
He was shaken, purified, thrilled....  He
repeated "two months&mdash;two months!" to still his
overmastering desires.  The silence had been
long and had grown heavy.  K. Stuyvesant
was afraid of it.  He gulped convulsively and
almost yelled: "Great night, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia nodded.  "Don't you want to
smoke?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I'd better," he said unsteadily, then,
"Oh, Cecilia!"  He reached toward her, then
drew back, for John came toward them.
</p>

<p>
"Cablegram," he said languidly, "for you,
Celie."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia opened it.  "From Marjory," she
said, after reading it by the light of John's
flash.  "She comes next week.  You must like
her," she added to Stuyvesant.  "She is my
best friend."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
"MY BEST FRIEND"
</h3>

<p>
Father McGowan frowned.
</p>

<p>
"I love him," said Cecilia.  "I don't care who
knows it.  Where's your handkerchief?  I&mdash;I
guess I've lost mine."
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan supplied the handkerchief.
Cecilia dabbed her eyes.  "You see she's
so attractive," she went on, "and I'm&mdash;I'm not
so very.  And then John, and everything.  I'm
ashamed of crying like this."  She gulped
again.  Father McGowan covered her small
hand with his.  "Dear child!" he said gently.
"Dear child!"
</p>

<p>
The fire leaped, spluttered and hissed with
capricious change.  Outside the weather was
grey, with a drab touch in the air.  The sky
was a shivery colour.  Cecilia and Father
McGowan sat on a wide davenport in the library.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he now?" asked Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"Playing tennis with Marjory," said Cecilia.
She again dabbed Father McGowan's handkerchief
on her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, drat!" said Father McGowan fiercely.
He put his other hand over the small one which
lay in his.  Cecilia tightened her fingers about
his thumb.
</p>

<p>
"I've been so miserable," she said, "that I've
even thought of being a nun.  I would if it
weren't for papa, and John,&mdash;and my hair.
(I couldn't bear to have it cut.)  And he shows
so plainly that he likes her, and then she tells
me what he says,&mdash;oh, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"Darn fool!" said Father McGowan.  "Is
he <i>crazy</i>?"  He glared at Cecilia with his
question, and she laughed unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ashamed to bother you," she said, "but
it helps, and I can't tell papa.  I think papa'd
kill him.  He's done nothing wrong, you know.
You can't help what your heart does."  She
avoided the fat priest's eyes and looked down
at her ringless left hand.  "There have been
lots of men," she said, "but none I could even
dream of marrying.  This is different, and&mdash;and
I do!  His eyes are so dear and so is he,
but I would love him anyway.  I think he's the
rest of me."
</p>

<p>
"Drat!" said Father McGowan forcibly.
"Drat him!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish I'd been left in the flat.  Then I'd
have grown up to marry some teamster.  It's
only when you reach for things too high above
you that your arms begin to ache,&mdash;then papa
and John, all the time misunderstanding each
other.  Both of them being hurt by this
money,&mdash;and I&mdash;I <i>love</i> him so!"
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia," said Father McGowan, "this
world is full of hurts.  You have to take them
as you do the weather, without a question.
Some one put them here to polish our little
souls....  After you are fifty you will accept
them with thankfulness and cease questioning.
The faith of childhood will return in a bigger
way, with a belief in the absolutely unknown.
Some one put them here to polish our little
souls.  They are here, let them polish, not
scratch."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Cecilia meekly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, drat!" said Father McGowan with an
entire change of tone.  "I don't <i>want</i> you
polished.  <i>Dear</i> child!  Drat him, is he <i>crazy</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah wandered in.  He was sullen.  He
had been talked to by a fat priest, who told
him that he should leave the discipline of a
certain doctor to God and the world,
explaining that it was rarely necessary for
humans to add to any one's unhappiness by a
mistaken sense of dealing out justice.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah had listened with his eyes on the
top shelf of a gilt cabinet which held a brick.
After Father McGowan had finished, Jeremiah
had spoken of the weather, and Jeremiah
was a good Catholic.  Father McGowan realised
it was a bad case.  He had abandoned it
for that time.
</p>

<p>
"And will yuh stay fer dinner?" asked the
sullen Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>will</i>," answered the priest decidedly.
Cecilia handed him a handkerchief, which he
folded carefully and put in his pocket.  Then
she got up and played "The Shepherd Boy"
for the King of Bricks.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Outside in the grey light a sullen-eyed man
played tennis with Marjory.  He played with
much energy and replied with scant courtesy to
Marjory's remarks.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia said that she was tired of entertaining,&mdash;that
I'd have to do it for her," sang out
the green-eyed.  K. Stuyvesant's chin squared.
</p>

<p>
"In," he called.  "I'm a fool to stick
around," was his mental comment on himself.
He was not surprised by the dead weight his
heart felt, although the sensation was new.
</p>

<p>
They finished their game and went toward
the house.  "You're doing lots for John," said
Marjory.  "He adores you!  Imitates your
every move!  You'll try to get him through
this smartness?"
</p>

<p>
In truth she did not consider it smartness,
for to her it was the natural attitude of young
men.  However she was clever enough to see
the way this big, silent man felt about it, and
to agree outwardly.
</p>

<p>
"I'd do anything to help one girl," he said
loudly.  He wanted Marjory to know how he
felt about Cecilia.  Perhaps she'd help him.
They reached the broad steps.
</p>

<p>
"After dinner I want to see you," whispered
Marjory.  "In the garden,&mdash;alone.  Something
about Cecilia.  By the white wall?"
</p>

<p>
"Not there," he answered quickly, "but by
the Italian dial, if you like."
</p>

<p>
In the hall he met a fat priest.  The man
was heartily uncordial, but he didn't much care.
After a few words he went up to his room.
There he stood by his window and looked on
the grey Sound.  A fog was creeping over it.
Everything was dismal and dull.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not much good," he muttered, "but no
one could love her more.  I would be&mdash;so good
to her.  So good.  Little Saint&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"  He
covered his eyes with his hands.  His hands
shook.
</p>

<p>
There was a tap on the door.  John came in.
"Hello, old chap!" he said energetically, the
languid indifference all gone from his tone.
"Can I stay and talk?"  He settled, while
K. Stuyyesant took a grip on himself, and tried
to bring himself to an agreeable acceptance of
his task.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In another wing of the house Cecilia was
dressing.  Marjory, gorgeous in a flame-coloured
negligee, lounged in a comfortable chair
and talked during the operation.
</p>

<p>
"You may go, Josephine," said Cecilia, "and
thank you."
</p>

<p>
"If I treated my maid as you do yours,"
said Marjory, "she'd have no respect for me."
</p>

<p>
"If I weren't decently kind," answered
Cecilia, "I'd have no respect for myself, and
Josephine likes me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my <i>dear</i>," said Marjory, "she <i>adores</i>
you."  Marjory scrutinised her nails.  "I told
Stuyvesant to-day," she said, "how much he'd
done for John.  You don't mind?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Cecilia.  "He has.  I'm
grateful."
</p>

<p>
"He said he was glad I wanted him to, that
he'd do anything for a certain girl.  He has the
dearest eyes, when he looks at you&mdash;oh, you
know how&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Cecilia, "I know."  There
was a pause while the only sound heard was
the brush on Cecilia's hair&mdash;the soft snap and
swish.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia," said Marjory, "<i>were</i> you engaged
to Tommy Dixon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Cecilia, "but, Marjory, I
can't bear to remember it.  It&mdash;it was while I
was much younger and hurt because of
something Annette Twombly had said.  I thought
I'd have to marry some one like that to help
papa.  You know how foolish duty may be at
nineteen?  He was of a splendid family.  I
thought papa would like it, when now I know
that all he wants is my happiness.  After all,
decayed flowers from a good plant are not
worth anything."
</p>

<p>
"When did you break it off?" asked Marjory.
</p>

<p>
"When he kissed me," answered Cecilia.  "It
taught me how intolerable love is unless it is
very true.  I will always remember those
kisses.  I can't forget them.  What are you
going to wear to-night?"  Cecilia changed the
subject with suddenness, for it made her sick.
</p>

<p>
"Black," answered Marjory.  Cecilia's heart
sank.  Marjory was so very pretty in black!
Marjory got up.  "Bye, childy," she called,
"I must go."  And she waved her hand airily
as she went out.
</p>

<p>
On the way down the hall she repeated
Cecilia's words: "I will always remember those
kisses.  I can't forget them."  That would do
very nicely for the little talk by the Italian dial....
She would play sympathy, understanding.
She would not lie, but if he cared to
misunderstand how could she, Marjory, help
that?  A sudden spark of her honest father
flew across her soul.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care!" she said in answer to it, "I
love him, I really do!"  Then the love and trust
of the small Cecilia twanged on a heart chord.
Marjory shut her eyes.  In her mind came
those of K. Stuyvesant Twombly, as he looked
when he gazed on the daughter of a "Brick
King."  Marjory hardened.  "She doesn't love
him as I do," she whispered; "she can't!"
</p>

<p>
She was only the echo of a single purpose:
cruel in its selfishness, animal in its origin, and
savage in intensity.

CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
ACCEPTANCE
</h3>

<p>
"Celie, be yuh happy?" asked Jeremiah anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" answered Cecilia.  She caught
her breath rather spasmodically and went on:
"Of course I'm happy!  Here I am, all
through being improved and ready to stay at
home with you and John.  Isn't that enough
to make any one happy?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want some new frills, or something?"
asked Jeremiah wistfully.  "You know
I can buy yuh anything, and I like to, good."
</p>

<p>
"I have so much," answered Cecilia.  She
went over to him and perched on the arm of
his chair.  "You and John are everything to
me," she said.  "When I have you I have
everything!"  She leaned toward him and
kissed him.  Her arms tightened fiercely about
his neck.  "You are <i>everything</i>!" she repeated
loudly.  'Iggins came sliding in with that effect
of being on casters, proper to butlers.
</p>

<p>
"Was yuh lookin' fer me, sir?" asked Jeremiah.
Higgins assented and delivered a small
box.  Then he elevated his head and left.
Outside the door he muttered of leaving.  He
recalled with bitterness his last post, where the
man of the house had been a "perfect gentleman"
and had thrown boots and curses at him
without partiality.
</p>

<p>
"'Sir!'" he echoed with a fine scorn.  "'Ow
is a man to keep 'is self-respect?"
</p>

<p>
Josephine tripped down the hall.  She
carried Marjory's small dog, who had a scarlet
coat buttoned about his small tummy.
"Dee-ar Eegeens!" she purred, then fluttered
her eyelashes.
</p>

<p>
"The post 'as its hadvantages," said Dee-ar
Eegeens, and followed in Josephine's direction.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Inside the library Cecilia stood by a window
with Jeremiah.  He was untying the string of
a small box and his fingers shook.
</p>

<p>
"I got it fer you, Celie," he said, "because I
thought you was peaked like."  He opened the
box reverently.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Twenty</i>-five thousand," said Jeremiah.
"<i>Look</i> at her!"  Jeremiah lifted his present
from the box.  The pendant of his present
looked like a lamp shade from Tiffany's.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oh!</i>" said Cecilia again.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Look</i> at that there diamond and emerald
and ruby all mashed together like!" said
Jeremiah proudly.  "<i>Look</i> at her!  <i>Don't</i> she
sparkle?"
</p>

<p>
"It does," said Cecilia; "it certainly does!"
</p>

<p>
"I told 'em to take out the pearls and put
more sparkly stuff in.  I sez, 'Put in all yuh
can!  Don't spare no expense.'  I sez, 'Make
her showy.  She's fer the best girl on
earth.'  They done it too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" said Cecilia.  Her eyes were a
little moist.  Tears came easily lately.  She
put her arms around Jeremiah's neck.
"Dear," she said, "I love it.  I can't say thank
you the way I want to."
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah didn't answer and she laid her
cheek against his shoulder.  Together they
looked out of the window on the green and
then the water's grey.
</p>

<p>
"Celie," said Jeremiah uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" answered Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Celie," he said, "you wasn't sweet on that
young Twombly?  You <i>wasn't</i>?"  Cecilia
shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you was frettin' over him,"
said Jeremiah; "you wasn't?"  Again he felt
her head move against his shoulder.  She clung
to him for a moment, and then straightened
and said, "I must go dress."  At the door she
paused and turned back.  "I love the pendant,"
she said.  "It is beautiful.  I <i>love</i> it!"
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah beamed widely.  "I knew yuh
would," he said boastfully.  "I sez, 'Spare no
expense.  It's fer my little girl that nursed
her maw, cooked her paw's meals, and then
learned him to wear a <i>dress</i>-suit.  None
smarter!'"
</p>

<p>
"It is beautiful, dearest," murmured Cecilia.
Then she left the room.  Alone, Jeremiah went
to stand below a portrait.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," he whispered, "what makes her
look like she wants to cry?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
PAIN
</h3>

<p>
"If it is any satisfaction," said Father
McGowan dryly, "I will assure you that he loves
you.  Anybody could see that.  I suppose it is
your father, Cecilia."
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Marjory&mdash;&mdash;" she started,
then stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"Marjory told me he said it was&mdash;papa,"
said Cecilia.  All the tragedy possible to feel
at twenty-one was in her young eyes.  "She
did it kindly," added Cecilia.  Then she
went on unsteadily: "I don't know why I am
not brave.  I am so ashamed.  He&mdash;he isn't
worth it."
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Father McGowan, "he
isn't."  Cecilia slipped her hand in his.  The
warm contact had brought her peace at many
times.  It did now, in a way.  "Cecilia," said
Father McGowan, "sometimes love means
pain.  You know Father Tabb's poem about it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Cecilia.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Once only did he pass my way<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When wilt Thou come again?<br />
  All, leave some token of Thy stay!'<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote (and vanished) 'Pain.'"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Cecilia tightened her fingers about Father
McGowan's thumb.  "You have always been
so good to me," she whispered.  "You have
always understood and helped me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, well!" said Father McGowan.
"What else am I here for?"
</p>

<p>
"Marjory said if I kept papa,&mdash;kept
papa&mdash;&mdash;" Cecilia stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Kept him in the backyard or in the cellar,
it would be better?" ended Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" said Cecilia.  "Please don't;
for two or three times I've felt like John,&mdash;I'm
<i>so</i> ashamed."
</p>

<p>
"Dear child!" Father McGowan said.
"Dear child!"
</p>

<p>
"I love papa," said Cecilia.  "It's only this
new feeling that unsettles me.  Sometimes I
think I'd pay any price.  Sometimes, like
John, I'm ashamed, and then how I <i>hate</i> myself!"
</p>

<p>
A gilded moon had slid from behind a line
of poplars.  It had shown Father McGowan
eyes that reflected an aching soul, tragic young
eyes, almost bitter in their hurt.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Cecilia held his fat hand against
her cheek.  Then she smiled at him bravely.
"I'm going to be good!" she said with a little
catch in her voice.  "I'm going to be good!"
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia Evangeline," said Father McGowan,
"dear child!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Marjory entered the room with a slam and a
swish.  "I telephoned Stuyvesant and asked
him to come out to dinner," she said.  "You
don't mind?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Cecilia, "certainly not."
</p>

<p>
"He seemed anxious to come," said Marjory
consciously.  Cecilia didn't reply.
</p>

<p>
"What's in that box?" asked Marjory.
</p>

<p>
"A present," answered Cecilia.  She took it
from the box and held it up for inspection.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord!" said Marjory.  "Your father?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia again did not reply.  Her cheeks
were pink and her eyes sparkled.
</p>

<p>
"If I were you," advised Marjory, "I
wouldn't wear it to-night.  You know how
conservative the Twomblys are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What he thinks is not vital to me," said
Cecilia.  "I shall wear it.  I <i>love</i> it.  I think
it's beautiful!"
</p>

<p>
"You dear child!" said Marjory.  She
looked on the small liar with respect.
Suddenly she was shocked into speechlessness.
The small liar was sobbing wildly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Marjory!  Oh, Marjory!" she gasped.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Much later Cecilia stood at the foot of the
broad stair.
</p>

<p>
"Where's your necklace?" asked Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Cecilia, "I forgot it, but I want
to wear it.  I do!  I'm going to get it now."  She
turned from him and ran up the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is!" she heard John call from the
porch.  Then came Marjory's loud laugh.  Cecilia's
breath came fast, and her fingers trembled
as they clasped the new necklace about
her throat.  She stood before the mirror a
minute before she started down.  "It <i>is</i> beautiful,"
she said, "and I am proud to wear it!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
That night Cecilia lay long wakeful.  She
had not slept much or well lately.  She heard
the different clocks follow each other with
minutes' difference in their chimes.  Hour after
hour....  Cruel hours....  Control left her
and she turned from side to side, restlessly
moving into what seemed, each time, a more
restless position.
</p>

<p>
She hoped K. Stuyvesant had believed her
when she said she thought her new necklace
beautiful.  She remembered John's sneer and
his question: "Been shopping at the 'Five and
Ten'?"
</p>

<p>
Best, she remembered Jeremiah's proud
pleasure in his gift.  The remembrance hurt,
and made her feel little.
</p>

<p>
There was a tap on her door which made
her strained nerves leap.  She sat up in bed
and turned on the lights, blinking in their
glare.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she called.
</p>

<p>
"It is I," answered Marjory.  "I've been
wakeful.  I want to talk with you for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"Come in," said Cecilia.  Marjory opened
the door and came across the room to sit on
the edge of Cecilia's bed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry you haven't slept," said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter," answered Marjory.
Cecilia saw that she was very tired, so tired
that she looked old.  She was the Marjory of
gay evening, with a grey veil shrouding her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going away," said Marjory abruptly.
Her fingers played with the coverlet and her
eyes avoided Cecilia's.  "I'm going back to
mamma," she continued.  "I think she needs
me, and&mdash;and I <i>hate</i> the States!"
</p>

<p>
"Marjory, <i>dear</i>!" said Cecilia, "I'm sorry&mdash;so
sorry."
</p>

<p>
"No one wants me," said the new Marjory.
"I only make trouble wherever I go.  No one
wants me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I always want you," said Cecilia.  "I do,
Marjory,&mdash;I really do."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you really mean that," said Marjory
slowly.  "I'm almost too little to understand
you, but I know you never lie."
</p>

<p>
"I lied about the necklace," said Cecilia; "I
don't think it beautiful, except for the love it
shows."
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia," said Marjory, "I can't be truthful.
I can't, Cecilia&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" answered Cecilia.  "You are!  I
know you better than any one.  You have been
my best friend always, and I say you are!"
</p>

<p>
Marjory's fingers plucked at the coverlet
restlessly.  She breathed in quick gasps.
Cecilia laid her hand on Marjory's.  "Perhaps
to-morrow you'll feel differently?" she suggested.
"You know dark makes things so much darker.
I'll do anything to make you happier.  I'll ask
Mr. Twombly to come out and play with you
often, Marjory dear."
</p>

<p>
"Don't, oh, don't!" whimpered Marjory.
Her shoulders shook.  Cecilia closed her eyes
a moment, and then spoke quite loudly and
steadily.  "Dear," she said, "I'm sure he loves
you.  I'm sure he does."
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" implored Marjory.  "Don't!"  She
threw back her head and spoke in a different
tone.  "I hate America!" she said viciously.  "I
hate everything!  Life, my place in it.  I hate
you for being so good!  I hate,&mdash;oh, God!  Oh,
God!"  Her tirade ended in a paroxysm of dry
sobs.  Small Cecilia reached out her arms and
drew Marjory's head against her soft bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear Marjory!" she whispered, "you
have been so good to me!  I would do anything
to make you happier!  <i>Anything!</i>  Marjory,
dear Marjory!"
</p>

<p>
Marjory sobbed on.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't worthy of my dreams," Cecilia
heard her say between gasps.  "I&mdash;they were
too big for me.  I knew it, but&mdash;&mdash;" she
stopped.  Cecilia, all uncomprehending,
baffled, said only, "Dear!" and again, "Dear!"
</p>

<p>
Some strange trouble this was to bring tears
to the dry-eyed Marjory, but Marjory needed
comfort, not questions.  "Dear!" she said once
again.  Marjory drew away.  "Oh, heavens!"
she said, laughing, "what an emotional actress I
could have been.  Forget this and sleep; I
shall."  She stood up, stretching.  Suddenly
she was again the new Marjory.  She looked
on Cecilia.  "I <i>did</i> try," she said, "and some
people can't be decent even when they try.
They can only get halfway."
</p>

<p>
"What?" began Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Marjory.  "Good-night."  She
started for the door, and then turned back.
She leaned above the bed and kissed Cecilia
rather fiercely, quite as if she thought of some
one else whom she loved in another way while
she did it.  After she'd gone Cecilia hid her
eyes.  Without reason the kisses of Tommy
Dixon were recalled.  Those of the life-half,
without a touch of soul.  Then Cecilia forgot
them in her wonder about Marjory.
</p>

<p>
"I would do anything for her happiness,"
thought Cecilia, "even that."  And then she
closed her eyes and asked to be strong.
</p>

<p>
When she opened them she saw a golden
streak across the floor.  The sun was up.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
A REQUEST
</h3>

<p>
"Miss Cecilia&mdash;&mdash;" said Stuyvesant Twombly
into the telephone which stood on his desk.
His heart hammered so that his ears ached, and
the furniture in the room swayed and bent.
</p>

<p>
"I want to ask you a favour," he heard.  "It
matters a great deal to me, and, well, to&mdash;&mdash;"
she stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he said, aware that his voice was
crisp.  He had not meant to have it so, but
his voice, when Cecilia was near, did as it
pleased.
</p>

<p>
"It's about John," he heard her say very
quickly.  "He&mdash;you know he cares a great deal
about you, and that you influence him greatly.
You did more than any one else ever has for
him."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure," interrupted K. Stuyvesant, "I'm
glad.  I don't mean that," he blurted out; "I
mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Cecilia; "I telephoned
you to ask you if you wouldn't come to the
house sometimes because of him?  I&mdash;I'm not
home very much.  The&mdash;the little incident of
the boat is quite forgotten&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant coughed.
</p>

<p>
"I understand you," said Cecilia.  "I hope
you do me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered K. Stuyvesant miserably.
</p>

<p>
"You will help him?" she questioned further.
</p>

<p>
"I will," he answered.  "I told Miss Marjory
I'd do&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes," broke in Cecilia, unable to bear more;
"she told me what you said.  I'll be more
grateful than you can ever know, too."
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant swallowed convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she said in a small voice.
"Good-bye," he answered gruffly.  He hung
up the receiver and stared across the room.
His teeth were set with cruel tightness on his
lower lip....  He remembered how her little
hand had crept into his beneath a blue and
green checked steamer blanket.  He almost
wished he could forget it....  And that
distance at which she'd kept him had not been
what he'd thought, her proving of his sudden
love, but only her inclination.  Lord, how he'd
dreamed, and still dreamed! ... He'd do
what he could for John.  He believed much
was possible.
</p>

<p>
And how even the sound of her voice left
him!  Shaking, and aching with his want.
First hot, then cold....  He stared, unseeingly,
across his office.  He recalled his first
evening at the country house when he'd stood
by the white wall with a Greek relief,
worshipping a little Irish maid.
</p>

<p>
Then Marjory had come.  He wished she
hadn't.  He almost hated her, and found no
reason why he should, except for her telling
him something which haunted his long nights....
"Cecilia, Cecilia!" ran through his head,&mdash;and
heart....  For her, he'd do what he
could for John.  He reached for the telephone
and called a number he knew too well.  After
an interval, and a request, John answered.
</p>

<p>
At first his tone was languid, then it leaped
into colour from pleasure, and K. Stuyvesant
hid his eyes....  John, genuine, echoed the
dearest Cecilia.  His voice, even in its grating
boy-quality, held a hint of hers.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll go riding?" K. Stuyvesant asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'd be jolly glad to!" answered John.  "I've
wanted to see you, but I thought I'd better not
bother you."
</p>

<p>
"We'll take in the aeroplane show," said
K. Stuyvesant, "if you like."  John liked very
much.  He hung up the receiver, looking like
a boy.  His thickened eyelids were lifted, his
eyes wide open.
</p>

<p>
Looking toward the photograph of Fanchette,
he recalled an engagement.  "You may
go to hell!" he said loudly, not stopping to
think that his staying away would not send her
there; but that she was more liable to its
admittance on earth, if he, and other idle young
men of his stamp, were with her.
</p>

<p>
The aeroplane show!  That would be great!
Of all the chaps he'd ever known he most
admired K. Stuyvesant, and to chum with him!
Well, wouldn't the fellows look!  Well,
rather!
</p>

<p>
In the hall he passed Jeremiah.  "Going out
with Stuyvesant," he called pleasantly.
Confiding his intentions or aim in direction was
unusual.  Both he and Jeremiah wondered at
it.  Jeremiah was so pleased that he was past
smiling.  A little quirk came in his heart, and
he whispered, "Just then he looked like Mary
used to when I brung her the wages.  He did!
I wished she could have saw him!"  Then
Jeremiah went on down the hall, stooping a little
more than usual, as he always did with the
thought that made him old.
</p>

<p>
"A bunnit with pink roses on!" he muttered
next.  That always came with his memory of
Mary, that "bunnit" that she never had.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Hello, Madden," said K. Stuyvesant.
John threw out his chest.  K. Stuyvesant had
acknowledged him a man.  "How're yuh?" he
added.  John said that he was well.  As they
spoke they sped away from the stern-faced
houses of New York's moneyed folk and into
its hum.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to be in town again," said John;
"awful glad to see you too.  Got beastly quiet
out there after Marjory left.  Can't be sleepy
while <i>she's</i> around!"  K. Stuyvesant assented.
</p>

<p>
"You mashed on her too?" inquired John.
K. Stuyvesant took his eyes, for the faintest
second, from the street ahead.  Then he looked
back.  He had answered.  John felt limp, and
adored with more fervor.  "Didn't mean to
offend," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
They had spent a pleasant afternoon.  At
least John thought so, the pleasantest, he
thought, for ages, but just now he was
suffering from a profound shock.  K. Stuyvesant
had said something that had left John mentally
holding on to his solar plexus.
</p>

<p>
"You say it's an evidence of <i>youth</i> to get
drunk?" said John.
</p>

<p>
"Uh huh," answered K. Stuyvesant in an
indifferent tone.  "Surest sign in the world
that a fellow's about nineteen.  You know how
it is, a chap wants to get old, be thought old,
so he imitates what he thinks is manhood.  Like
a kid, picking out gilt instead of gold, he picks
out a drunk, and thinks it's a man.  Look at
that motor!  <i>Some</i> peach!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed John absently.  However he
hadn't seen the motor.  He was hoping with
violence that K. Stuyvesant had not heard of
his lurid past.  For the first time he thought
of his "past" without pleasure.  Heretofore
his "past" had been like a treasured museum.
Each piece of fresh wickedness added to it with
great pleasure, and the knowledge that its
value was greater.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody goes through that stage," said
K. Stuyvesant, quite as if he'd read John's
mind.  "It's the measles of the pin-feather age.
Look here, John, whatcha think of that shaft?
Looks kinda heavy to me."
</p>

<p>
"Hollow, aluminum," said John in a little
voice.  He was suffering from a complete
emotional turn over.  It was difficult to
contemplate shafts.  K. Stuyvesant fingered a frame
with interest.  "Like to own one," he said,
"darned if I wouldn't!"
</p>

<p>
"Keep yer hands off them machines!" said
a loud voice, the owner of which glared on
K. Stuyvesant.  K. Stuyvesant removed his hands.
He also smiled.  John was nettled.  His great
dignity was hurt.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell him who you were?"
he asked of Stuyvesant with heat.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord!" said Stuyvesant.  "Why
should I?  The fact that I draw a little more
on pay day than the next fellow doesn't give
me the divine right to paw all over the
works."  John was silent.  He was again mentally
steadying his solar plexus.  The afternoon had
been full of earthquakes to his small ideas, and
reconstruction.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said John seriously, "did you
go through that period?"
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant looked sheepish, then he
laughed.  "Sure," he said; "I was a real devil
at twenty.  I couldn't stand girls because I
thought they laughed at me, so I decided to
drink myself to death.  My proud ideal was to
be the heaviest drinker in New York, and to
be so pointed out.  Sometimes I stayed out as
late as two."
</p>

<p>
John laughed with him, although his inclinations
were far from laughter.  Coarse hands
were despoiling his altar, and, worse, laughing
at it, as an echo of childhood.
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant had seated himself on a folding
chair that smelled of a hearse.  John
settled by him.  "These chairs always make me
think of Uncle Keefer's funeral," said
Stuyvesant.  "Mother went, draped in eighteen
yards of crape.  She mourned him deeply until
she heard the will, then she tore off the weeds
and had 'em burned."
</p>

<p>
John was far away, so the subject of Uncle
Keefer's funeral was abandoned.
</p>

<p>
"Did&mdash;did you collect girls' photographs?"
asked John.
</p>

<p>
"Girls never liked me," said Stuyvesant,
"and guns weren't allowed.  I did use to have
a gallery of second-rate actresses decorating
my boudoir.  I bought the pictures at a
photographer's.  The less they wore the better.
Lord, what a calf period!  Hiccoughing, little
asses!  Makes me sick to think of it!"  Real
disgust was written on K. Stuyvesant's face.
John pushed his hair away from his forehead.
He felt very hot.  If some one else had spoken,
he would not have noticed.  But
K. Stuyvesant&mdash;chased by most of New York!
Honestly liked by the fellows, as a good sport.
Owner of several cups for several achievements.
Rated as "damned indifferent, but a
bully chap!"
</p>

<p>
John felt weak and little,&mdash;worse,&mdash;he felt
terribly young.  He looked away from
K. Stuyvesant.  Perhaps K. Stuyvesant sensed
something of his misery, for he laid a big hand
on John's shoulder.  The hand was cheering.
</p>

<p>
"Where you going to college?" he asked.
John explained that he had not thought of
going, that he hated work, and that a certain
amount of study seemed necessary for school.
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant talked persuasively.  "If you
studied this winter you could enter next fall,"
he said; "you have all of the year to do it in.
I'll look up some decent tutors, and help all
I can, but I'm darned stupid, myself.  Wish
I weren't.  All I could do would be to root.
I'd do that!"
</p>

<p>
"Would you kind of help me keep interested?"
said John, looking at his feet.  "I
haven't done anything that I haven't wanted
to, for so long, that I've lost the knack.  If
you'd help me keep interested,&mdash;will you?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet I <i>will</i>!" answered K. Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said John quietly.  K. Stuyvesant's
hand tightened on John's shoulder
convulsively.  Then he took it away.  Cecilia's
voice had seemed to say the little "thank you."  He
was shaken, and vastly relieved when John
began to talk of monoplanes.  He wondered
with dull misery if all his years would be full
of this "where is the rest of me?" feel.  "Why
isn't she here?  <i>How</i> can we be apart when I
feel like this?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at John.  The monoplane essay
had ceased.  "How is your sister?" asked
K. Stuyvesant gruffly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Cecilia," said John, "I wish you'd come in."
He was by the door of his bedroom as he spoke.
Cecilia answered that she'd be happy to come
in, and stepped past him.  "I'm going to
college," said John dramatically after he'd closed
the door.  "Stuyvesant wants me to.  He
thinks he can get me in his Frat.  He's going
to buy an aeroplane, but he says I can't go
up unless you say so.  Can I?  Are you glad
I'm going to college?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was entirely bewildered, but said she
was glad he had decided to go to college.  She
sat in a low chair by a table, and her
bewilderment increased when John took several
photographs from his bureau and threw them
carelessly into the waste basket.  Next she saw
Fanchette thrown in a table drawer, which
was then slammed.
</p>

<p>
"John dear," said Cecilia, "<i>are</i> you sick?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered John, then she saw a twinkle
in his eyes, often there in the little boy days.
"I'm Irish," he continued, "and I can see a
joke, even on myself.  I've tried to be very
old, Celie."
</p>

<p>
She put her arms around his neck.  He hid
his face against her throat, and she felt him
shake.  The joke was forgotten.  "It's so
hard," she heard in muffled tones; "I'm
ashamed of dad, and then I try to gloss it over,
I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it hadn't been for dad," said Cecilia
slowly, "we would have both been getting slabs
of peat out of an Irish bog, surely barefooted,
probably hungry."
</p>

<p>
"It would have been better," said John bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," answered Cecilia, "but that is
not the question.  We're here."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," said John, and laughed a little.
He had drawn away, ashamed of his emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Have I seemed like a kid to you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia looked at him squarely.  "Yes," she
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you help me?" he blurted out.
"Let me be the laughing stock of every one.
The son of a multi-millionaire, the laughing
stock of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you recollect," interrupted Cecilia, "I
did try.  More than once.  You told me I was
only a girl, that I didn't understand.  You
even told me to mind my business on several
occasions."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Celie!" said John.
</p>

<p>
"Dear!" answered Cecilia, in another tone.
She sat on the arm of the chair in which he'd
thrown himself.  He put an arm around her.
</p>

<p>
"Now that you are awake," said Cecilia,
"what do you think of those near-men you've
been introducing me to all summer?"  She
was smiling.  John's inclination to anger
vanished.  He smiled foolishly instead.
</p>

<p>
"The mixture is the trouble," he said, "with
no one whom you can respect to guide you,&mdash;no
power above.  I feel better, naturally, than
the Gov'ner."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia let that pass.  "Orchids and hollyhocks
in one bed," she said, "but in time I believe
you'll come to love the homely honesty
of hollyhocks,&mdash;those that thrive in all
weathers.  I believe you will, John.  I do."
</p>

<p>
He got up and stretched.  The new man
had gone.  She saw this, and rose with him.
"Good-bye, dear," she said in a very everyday
tone; "I'm glad you had a good time this
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
In a flash he changed again.  His arms
closed about her soft body, and he kissed her.
"Celie," he said huskily, "you're the <i>best</i> fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"Johnny," she answered, "you <i>darling</i>!"
He gave her another squeeze, and released her.
Then he was again the conscious boy.  "This
darn tie," he muttered, looking in a mirror;
"it wads up rottenly!"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia left indifferently, but outside his
door she turned and kissed a panel opposite
her small head.
</p>

<p>
She wore the want-to-cry expression which
so worried Jeremiah, but her eyes were happy.
They looked like those of a little girl who holds
the best beloved, just mended, doll, all fixed
up, ready to love and spank some more, to
scold, forgive, and kiss.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
PINK
</h3>

<p>
"You are an advocate of gum-chewing?"
asked Miss Annette Twombly, with a faint,
not too pleasant smile.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Cecilia, "but I do think we
ought to give them a good time, not reform
them.  Why, they get discipline all day at their
work.  I wanted to make them forget that, and
all their imperfections."  She turned with the
words to glance about the group of young
women who sat in the office of the Girls' Club.
</p>

<p>
There was a vague murmur.  "But&mdash;gum&mdash;!" Cecilia
heard in a voice which held
horror.
</p>

<p>
"My idea," said Annette, in her cool, slow
voice, "was to give them higher ideals, and to
teach them not to wear those horrid, pink silk
blouses, you know.  Teach them that it isn't
nice to chew gum, and,&mdash;ah,&mdash;well, give them
a <i>larger</i> life."
</p>

<p>
"How are you going to give it?" asked Cecilia.
"I see what you are going to destroy,
but what are you going to put in their places?
I think a certain amount of pink is necessary.
It has to be <i>very</i> bright, for there is so little
of it.  It has to reach a long way."
</p>

<p>
Annette didn't think this worth answering.
She simply raised her shoulders and eyebrows
in a gesture denoting suffering tolerance and
pity.  Then she turned to a neighbour and spoke
in an undertone.  They laughed, and Cecilia
flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Are you an upholder of the green velvet
'throw' on the parlour organ, Miss Madden?"
asked a young woman, noted for her bizarre
dress.
</p>

<p>
"I am when the green velvet is the only possible
beauty for them,&mdash;the only reachable one.
I think it's so narrow," she went on heatedly,
"to make them enjoy themselves just in our
way,&mdash;to inflict our likes and dislikes because
it's possible to do so.  I want to give these
girls what <i>they</i> consider a good time, and what
they want.  Patterns for good times differ.
I want dances instead of classes in art.  They
need them."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear,&mdash;gum, and those fearful
frocks!  Annette meant to tell them not to
wear cheap laces, but to dress plainly, and
suitably to their station," explained a drab young
lady whose own dress looked as if it had been
designed for a futurist ball.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia sighed.  She saw a band of heavy-eyed
and tired-out girls denied their little
cravings for beauty.  She saw them laying
aside pink blouses which brought a faint pink
into their small, starved souls.  She saw them
trying to be ladies, and losing the little solace
of "spear-mint gum," and roses of cabbage
size and architecture on their cheap hats.
</p>

<p>
"I think they need the pink," said Cecilia.
"If their dress is criticised I think the Club
is failing in its mission.  Every one will criticise
them, few will love them.  Let's leave their
manners and their dresses to their own
management.  Let us just try to make them forget
the factories, and the flat crowded full of
children.  I wanted to give them a place where
they could bring their beaux."
</p>

<p>
"We agreed about the dances," said Miss
Twombly; "I shall <i>adore</i> coming to them!
Won't they be <i>killing</i>?"  A hum of voices
followed this, in which was heard: "But their
horrible frocks!"&mdash;"In the end they would
thank us!"&mdash;"Give them a vision of a larger,
more helpful life!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall not subscribe to a reformatory,"
said Cecilia loudly.  She hated to say it, but an
echo of some one who had wanted a "bunnit
with pink roses on" flew before her.  She meant
to do all she could to help other people get, and
keep, their particular brands of pink roses.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia's contribution for the club's
maintenance was large.  It was agreed that for the
present at least no helpful hints as to the bad
taste of its members' clothes should be given.
Cecilia looked at a small watch, and got up.
She said good-bye pleasantly.  When the door
closed after her there was a surge of noise.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Annette in a carrying tone,
"of course she <i>would</i> sympathise.  I suppose
her own tastes are really theirs.  <i>Have</i> you
ever seen her father?"
</p>

<p>
"She plays 'The Shepherd Boy,' and 'The
Storm in the Alps' for him every evening,"
said the bizarre.
</p>

<p>
"My <i>dear</i>," said another, "<i>have</i> you seen the
boy?  He is <i>really</i> quite possible and they say
that the horrible old man is fabulously wealthy
too."
</p>

<p>
"Criminal!" breathed Annette.  Her eyes
were angry and full of resentment.
</p>

<p>
"Annette," said a girl from across the room,
"how are you getting on?  I think it's too
original of you!"
</p>

<p>
"You aren't still doing that?" asked another.
Annette nodded.
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked a bewildered onlooker.
</p>

<p>
"Working, really work," she was informed.
</p>

<p>
"My <i>dear</i>, how sweet!" said the informed.
"Isn't it ennobling, and broadening, and all
that kind of thing?"
</p>

<p>
Annette nodded, and then spoke flippantly
of it as a "lark."  Her bravado was a bit too
thick.  Several young people who knew something
of Mrs. Twombly's investments looked
at each other across Annette's head.
</p>

<p>
After she left there was another free
discussion.  "Social secretary," said the drab one,
"to a horrid person from Ohio, or the state of
Washington, or somewhere terribly west.
Trying to break in, lots of money, but
oh,&mdash;like the Maddens."
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't Stuyvesant a huge fortune?" asked
the bizarre.  "Why doesn't he help then?
Though his not doing so is quite what I'd
expect.  I tried to be so pleasant to him on
one occasion, and he was absolutely <i>rude</i>!
Really rude!  He said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had stopped at Mrs. Smithers' on
her way home.  She sat by the stove holding
the latest Smithers on her lap.
</p>

<p>
"We got it with tradin' stamps," said
Mrs. Smithers.  She held up a purple vase which
had evidently been created by some one
suffering with a toothache.  Mrs. Smithers was
trying not to smile.  She felt that she should
be easily careless with her new grandeur, but
it was hard to be so.  "Look at that there
seascape," she said, turning the seascape side
toward Cecilia, "an' that there sailor with his
girl.  Ain't she purty?  My old man, he sez
if he seen one like her, he wouldn't come home
no more!"  Cecilia joined Mrs. Smithers' loud
laughter over the "old man's" subtle humour.
</p>

<p>
"Two books," Mrs. Smithers explained after
the laughter had ceased, "an' next time we're
going to get a plush photograph album.  It
has a mirror-like on top, with daisies and I
dunno what all painted around.  <i>Hand</i> painted
on that there velvet, mind yuh.  It's <i>swell</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"I imagine it is," agreed Cecilia.  "You like
to have pretty things, don't you?" she questioned.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Smithers' wide and fat face clouded.
"Dearie," she said, "yuh gotta have gilt an'
fancy vases to make yuh ferget how homely
most life is.  I wish you could have saw me
yesterday.  My Gawd, I get tired a-doin' the
wash, an' Jim so tony, him usin' <i>two</i> shirts a
week!  Well, I didn't mind the sweatin' all
day, the way I do over the wash, f er all I seen
was that there vase a-settin' there.  Now ain't
it purty?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia agreed that it was.  Mrs. Smithers
smiled again.  "Why," she exclaimed, "I
nearly forgot Lena's dress&mdash;the one she's
going to wear to the club dance.  She set up
'til one last night a-fixing it.  She was tickled
to fits about it.  Looka here."  Mrs. Smithers
reached below the dining table and took out
the third box from the bottom.  She opened it
reverently.  It disclosed a dress of cheap and
flimsy lawn, made in the most extreme of
styles.  There was black velvet on it, several
bales of lace, and some roses.  Its colour was
pink.
</p>

<p>
"How lovely!" said Cecilia, and she meant
it; for Cecilia saw what the colour meant,&mdash;what
it brought,&mdash;and the dress to her was
truly lovely.
</p>

<p>
"Yessir," said Mrs. Smithers; "Lena, she
sez, 'Maw, I feel like a queen in this here!'
(she's partial to pink) an' yuh oughta see her
in it.  Mebbe she ain't purty.  Her gentleman
friend, who works at Helfrich's delicatessen
store, cold meat counter, yuh know,&mdash;he sez,
'My Irish rose,' when he seen it.  That's a song,
'My Irish Rose.'  The Kellys got it on the
graphaphone.  It's swell.  Ever hear it?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had not.
</p>

<p>
"I wish she had a pink hat," said
Mrs. Smithers, "an' then she could wear this to
church.  First Luthern, we go to,&mdash;that one
with the fancy brick, corner of Seventh,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have a hat," said Cecilia, "that I'm going
to send to Lena.  It's pink, and it has lots of
roses on it!"
</p>

<p>
Tears came to the little eyes of
Mrs. Smithers.  She beamed widely.  "I didn't
mean fer to hint," she said; "honest to Gawd,
I didn't."
</p>

<p>
"I know," answered Cecilia, "and you know
I love to send Lena things.  Is she still
coughing, and is she drinking the milk I send?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Mrs. Smithers, "but she
don't just like it.  She likes evaporated better,
bein' used to it."  Mrs. Smithers looked
doleful.  The mention of Lena's cough always
made her so.  Her expression was like that of
a meditative pig, for her small eyes and fat
face together provided everything but the
grunt.  However, to Cecilia she was beautiful,
for Cecilia saw the love in Mrs. Smithers'
soul, which she spread around her seven
children and the "old man."
</p>

<p>
"I won't forget the hat," called Cecilia from
the doorway, "and it shall be <i>very</i> pink!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Miss Madden, meet my gentleman friend."  The
gentleman friend shuffled his feet and
emitted a raucous "Pleased tuh meet yuh."
</p>

<p>
It was the night of the first dance at the
Girls' Club.  Little knots of its members stood
around the edges of the floor, laughing often,
and loudly.  The gentlemen friends seemed to
spend their time deciding which foot to stand
on, and then shifting to the other.
</p>

<p>
The committee of "uplift workers" rushed
around wildly, doing nothing.  It was notable
that Cecilia was the one to whom the
"gentleman friends" were introduced.
</p>

<p>
Lena Smithers came up to Cecilia.  "That
hat," she said, "I dunno how to thank yuh!
Paw, he's talkin' alla time about them roses.
They're grand!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you liked it, dear," said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," went on Lena more shyly, "an' my
gentleman friend, him who clerks at the
delicatessen, he likes it too.  Honest, that boy's
grand to me!  They ain't hardly an evening
that he don't bring me a string of sausage or
a hunk of ham!"  Cecilia looked impressed and
murmured, "Really?"
</p>

<p>
"Um hum!  Gawd's truth!" said Lena.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ensminger," said a fat girl, towing a
flaxen-haired boy with no chin.  "Soda
fountain clerk to the Crystal.  Better kid him on,
Miss Madden, mebbe he'll give yuh a soda!"
</p>

<p>
There was loud laughter at this persiflage.
Suddenly Cecilia forgot it, her surroundings,
the gentlemen friends, in fact everything but
the cruelly fast pumping of her small heart,
for across the room she saw John coming in,
and by him Stuyvesant Twombly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"How did Mr. Twombly happen to come?"
Cecilia asked of John much later, when they
were dancing.
</p>

<p>
"Why," answered John, "I told him of it,
and he said, 'Let's go down.  Would your
sister mind?'  Of course I said, 'No.'"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," answered Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Who's the girl who dances like a duck with
the rheumatism?" asked John.  "She walked
halfway up my shins, got discouraged, gave
it up, and then later started it all over again."
</p>

<p>
"Sweet persistency," murmured Cecilia.
Her eyes were on the partner of the duck with
the rheumatism, K. Stuyvesant.  He looked
warm.
</p>

<p>
The music stopped.  Cecilia and John found
themselves with the duck and her partner.
K. Stuyvesant stepped toward Cecilia with
determination.  "Will you <i>please</i> give me the
next?" he said.  His request was made in a
desperate tone, a tone absolutely unsuitable
for the asking of a dance.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Cecilia, "there are so many
girls here who sit about.  I have to see that
they have partners, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on!" broke in John.  "You dance;
I'll do the proper for you."  K. Stuyvesant
put a hand on John's arm; the touch was full
of gratitude.  Then the music started in a
slow, sentimental, sweet waltz song, popular
that season.  K. Stuyvesant invented several
new steps.  It was good that Cecilia was an
unusual and adaptable dancer, for his tempo
and intentions were mixed.  "What is this?"
he asked at last.
</p>

<p>
"A waltz," answered Cecilia, and at that he
stopped his mixture of one-step and maxixe.
"Excuse me," he said gruffly.  Beads of wet
stood out on his forehead.  He was out of
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to stop?" asked Cecilia.
"It's warm and you seem tired."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" he said passionately.  She looked
up at him, and when their eyes met his arm
tightened with a spasmodic quickness about
her; then he turned a deep mahogany colour
and stared unseeingly across her head.  He
had not meant to do that.  He wondered what
she'd think of him.
</p>

<p>
As for Cecilia, she shut her eyes and tried
to be indignant.  It was an insult, an insult
when he felt as Marjory said he did, an
insult!  But oh, how sweet, how sweet!
</p>

<p>
The music stopped.  "Thank you," said
K. Stuyvesant huskily.  Then he left Cecilia with
many maidens and singled out John.  "If you
don't mind, I'm going home now," he said.
"I'm tired.  Thank you for bringing me
along."
</p>

<p>
He looked back toward Cecilia.  He saw the
top of her golden head, surrounded by others
of more elaborate coiffure.  They made a
worshipping circle around her.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh!" said K. Stuyvesant.  He recalled
the little second when he'd drawn her nearer.
"I'm not sorry!" he thought, then turned to
hurry away from the lights and the music, for
he wanted to be alone.

CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
FIRELIGHT
</h3>

<p>
"It's a serious," said a boy with a voice like
a nutmeg grater.
</p>

<p>
"Yuh boob!" exploded his companion.  "He
means a serial," he explained to Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"And," said Father McGowan, "you have
come to me because you are temporarily
embarrassed for funds?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep," said the nutmeg grater.  "We're
broke."
</p>

<p>
"An' it's that exciting!  Every time they
busts up an automobile an' wrecks a train&mdash;we'd
pay yuh back,&mdash;an' him an' her in it,
they&mdash;&mdash;" broke in the other.
</p>

<p>
"You'd like a loan," said Father McGowan.
"Well, well, here it is.  What's the name of it?"
</p>

<p>
"'The Iron Claw,'" said the younger
impressively.  "It's grand.  Them there shows
learn yuh a lot too."  His voice showed his
great thirst for knowledge.  Father McGowan
smiled.  He was urged to go along, with the
assurance that they would also pay for that
in the future, but he refused on the plea of
work.
</p>

<p>
He went to the rectory door with them and
let them out into the dismal snowfall, the first
of the season.  Half-hearted, damp, then he
went back to his study, with a tender look in
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking of a small boy who had
known no such pleasures&mdash;a small boy brought
up by an always-old aunt, whose heart and soul
were cut square, and without any dimples.  He
had been a very quiet small boy with a great
hankering for nails and something to pound
with.
</p>

<p>
He had gone through the pound period without
pounding, and when he reached the dream
time he knew that dreams to his unyielding
old aunt would be as troublesome as nails, so
he had kept silent.
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan's eyes still held the wistful
look that had come into them at seventeen.
He recalled all his naillessness as he saw two
joyful theatregoers start off to see "The Iron
Claw," but in thinking of it there was no
regret&mdash;only a gratitude that from his denials
had come a backyard full of junk and a paradise
for many little boys who otherwise would
have gone without their small-boy heaven.
</p>

<p>
"She was a good woman!" said Father
McGowan; "a good woman!"  He was thinking
of the still old aunt who'd brought him up.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Are you well, Father McGowan-dear?"
asked Cecilia later in the afternoon when
Father McGowan had settled before a fire in
the Madden library.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," answered Father McGowan.
"Have a little cold, but I feel splendidly."  Cecilia
did not look impressed, and certainly
Father McGowan's aspect was not convincing.
His head was thrown back against the chair,
and his breath came raspingly.
</p>

<p>
"A hot lemonade," said Cecilia rather to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" said Father McGowan.  "Never!
Cecilia, you are a dear child.  Don't irritate
me.  I hate lemonades.  They make me think
of money for the parish house, and they are
bad enough cold."
</p>

<p>
"Hot toddy?" suggested Cecilia; her eyes
twinkled.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;!" replied Father McGowan softly.
Cecilia rang, spoke to a haughty person in
buttons, and soon Father McGowan was
sipping something warm which did not smell of
lemons.
</p>

<p>
"How's the pain?" asked Father McGowan
in a commonplace tone; he studied the glass
he held.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," answered Cecilia, "it is the same, but
I am braver.  I <i>will</i> be good, Father
McGowan.  I can't help lov&mdash;caring for him.  I
fixed my hair eight times the other day when
I knew I'd see him, and used an eyebrow
pencil Marjory left, but it wasn't becoming, and
I washed it off.  I can't help caring for him,
although I know he's unworthy.  I seem to
have lost my handkerchief,&mdash;thank
you."  Father McGowan supplied a large square.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't use to cry much, did you, dear
child?" he asked gently.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Cecilia, "and I don't now
except with you.  You see, when I voice it it
becomes so tragically real.  It is fixed because
I speak it to a human, while when I think of
it it seems like a bad dream.  It&mdash;it doesn't
seem possible that I can care so much, while
he doesn't."
</p>

<p>
The fat priest reached for Cecilia's hand.
He lifted it and kissed it.  Cecilia looked
surprised.
</p>

<p>
"A token of immense respect and humble
love, dear child," said Father McGowan.
"Kisses," he continued, "Cecilia, tie to the man
who humbly kisses your hand.  There are two
kinds, the kind who wants only your lips and
the kind who humbly touches your hand and
who longs to be absolved by whimpering out
his shames against your throat.  Lord, what
an old fool I am!  <i>What</i> a subject for a priest
to lecture on!"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was silent, for she was thinking of
Stuyvesant's kisses, which still burned her
palm.  They had held humbleness,&mdash;and
hunger.  She remembered how he had muttered
that he "darn well wanted to get down on his
knees, gosh!  How he <i>did</i> love&mdash;&mdash;"  And
then Mrs. Higgenmeyer had come along and
called loudly of the night: "Purty night, ain't
it?" and, worse, the chaperone of Boston had
then appeared and said in her crisp, quick-cut
way: "'Beautiful night of stars,' as our
inimitable Mr. Browning said."
</p>

<p>
Then the man with the Vandyke beard from
Philadelphia had passed.  He had crossed forty
times, had a valet, and complained of the coffee
and service, therefore commanding every one's
respect.  "Stevenson," he had corrected in
passing.  "Horrid person!" said Miss Hutchinson,
but to Cecilia there were no horrid persons,
for the world was full of a tall, gruff
man, and her heart was swollen from his hot
kisses on her small palm.  Her eyes must have
told him something of this, for he muttered,
"Dear!" with the impetuosity of a loosened
champagne cork.  "What say?" Miss Hutchinson
had asked.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan," said Cecilia, "shall I
ever be allowed to forget my inferiority to the
most?  It is always there, even when they ask
me for money for their charities.  They say,
'Mrs. Dash has subscribed.  <i>You</i> will probably
<i>want</i> to.'  By right of bricks, I purchase
my admission.  Shall I always feel this way?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," answered Father McGowan.
"When you get past thirty you forget how
you feel&mdash;that is, if you're any good.  After
that you think of others, and the <i>ego</i> is rubbed
down by the world into its proper size."
</p>

<p>
"I <i>am</i> a pig!" said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"You're not!" disagreed Father McGowan.
"No one could call you that&mdash;&mdash;" He paused.
"For a long time," he went on, "I've wanted to
say something to you, because you are too near
it to get a perspective.  I want you to look
around at the snobs who do not mix with those
in trade, and then I want you to ask what
grandpapa did.  Probably he made pretzels
or ran a laundry.  Do not ask the immediate
members of the family of this, for they may
not like it, but ask some <i>kind</i> friend.  You
and John, you people of stronger, fresher
blood, are America.  You are what comes in
and puts bright eyes into depleted stock and
takes out the hiccoughs.  Don't apologise for
your strength and the fact that papa's
reservations for his first trip were made in the
steerage."
</p>

<p>
"I don't," answered Cecilia.  "I'm rather
blatantly proud of it, although since boarding
school I haven't bragged of it."
</p>

<p>
"In time you may even elevate your lorgnette
and ask coldly, 'Who <i>is</i> she?'" suggested
Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" said Cecilia, "I'll <i>never</i> do that!"
</p>

<p>
"Your children probably will!" said Father
McGowan, and then he said "Drat!" to his
own stupid self.
</p>

<p>
"My children," said Cecilia, "are gentle,
white ghosts, and they play and do only what I
dream.  They would never do that, I would
send them from my arms first, and I do&mdash;love
them.  My arms would be empty.  Am I going
to be a sentimental old maid, Father
McGowan-dear?"
</p>

<p>
Father McGowan said he thought not.
Then he turned and again quite brazenly kissed
Cecilia's small palm.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia," he said, "to-day seems like the end
of the world to me....  My soul is on wings.
Dear child, I wish you could know what you
have always been to me.  But you do, don't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Father McGowan-dear," answered
Cecilia.  "I have known.  I have always
brought my worst hurts to you, and one does
that only to one who loves."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said Father McGowan, unused
to personal sentiment and awkward from
it, "now we understand.  How's John?"
</p>

<p>
"Wonderful," answered Cecilia.  She smiled
mischievously.  "Almost a boy again," she
added in explanation.
</p>

<p>
"Twombly responsible?" asked Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, "entirely.  His ideals
when transplanted are unusually good.
However, they do not seem to take root in him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said Father McGowan.  He
stretched in a tired way and said he must go.
No, he couldn't stay for dinner, for he was to
take the night turn at nursing a burned iron
moulder.  "Won't he be thirsty when he sniffs
my lemonade?" said Father McGowan.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia rang; the lofty person appeared.
"Just a minute," said Father McGowan.  "I
want one more word with you."  The person
faded.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia," said Father McGowan, "there's a
doctor to whom your father is playing God.
I don't want to bother you about it, but to-day,
coming here, I somehow felt as if I ought
to."  Father McGowan settled on the edge of a
chair, and he told Cecilia the dry facts of the
ruin of Doctor Van Dorn.  "Try to make your
father see that it's better not to tamper with
the works," he ended; "to leave that to whoever
or whatever is pushing the old ball around....
Well, good-bye, dear child.  Oh, I can
get out without the help of his Royal Buttons,
thank you."
</p>

<p>
After he left Cecilia again settled in front
of the fire to think of her new problem.  Her
brain eluded it with a maddening persistency.
She thought of a new frock, the Girls' Club, a
dance.  Then again of the really horrible
revelation, and the unexpected obstinacy of her
father.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at a softly coloured painting
above the mantel, which she'd had painted in
Paris.  It had been marvellously done, and
especially since the only model had been a small
tintype.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," said Cecilia, "you would not
want him punished, would you?  And,&mdash;is
there any punishment more cruel than life?"
</p>

<p>
The painting smiled down gently.
</p>

<p>
"Pink roses," it seemed to say.  "There are
always pink roses, but youth must hold them
to see their beauty....  Seeing no loveliness
in dreams denied, no heights in greatest
depths...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Come in!" said John.  "Please!"  K. Stuyvesant
hesitated.  He wanted to, for just a
glimpse of Cecilia was everything to him; but,
she&mdash;she had not wanted to see him.  "I am
out a great deal," she said in that memorable
'phone message,&mdash;also, "I have quite forgotten
the little episode of the boat."  Those two
sentences had made things cruelly plain.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," begged John, "you must be cold!"
</p>

<p>
K. Stuyvesant got out of his machine, and
went with John into the long-waisted house.
</p>

<p>
"Fire in the library," said John; "wood, you
know.  Bully, aren't they?"  John, ahead,
stopped with his hand on the drapery which
softened the broad doorway into the library.
He put the other, silencingly, on K. Stuyvesant's
arm.  Cecilia sat in front of the fire.  She
held a framed picture in her hands, standing
upright on her knees.  Looking,&mdash;looking,&mdash;looking,
she was.  They stood there for what
seemed to Stuyvesant many minutes.  He felt
himself grow hot, cold, then he longed to shake
John,&mdash;again, hug him.
</p>

<p>
"Celie!" called John.  With a crash the
photograph slipped from her hands to the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried breathlessly, "<i>how</i> you
frightened me!"
</p>

<p>
"Come in, Stuyv," said John, loudly.
"Look what she's looking at!  <i>Your</i>
picture!"  Stuyvesant didn't answer.  He had set his
teeth, and his chin was very square.
</p>

<p>
"How long were you there?" asked Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"We just came in," said Stuyvesant, before
John could answer.
</p>

<p>
"I just picked up your picture," said Cecilia.
"John hadn't shown it to me.  I'm sorry I was
stupid and broke the glass."
</p>

<p>
She moved, and Stuyvesant's eyes followed
her, a heartache too large for concealment
showing in them.
</p>

<p>
"Whatcha go for?" asked John.  "Stay and talk!"
</p>

<p>
"I really can't, dear," she answered.  "I'm
sorry."  Then, nodding, she disappeared.  In
a moment they heard the sound of the piano.
Some one who could feel, as well as play, was
tinkling out "The Shepherd Boy."
</p>

<p>
"She does it for dad," said John, "because
he likes it, but you ought to hear her play good
music.  She's a wonder; why, in school&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
John broke off, another thought interrupting:
"Why didn't you let me jolly her about your
picture?" he asked.  "It was a great chance."
</p>

<p>
"She wouldn't like it," answered K. Stuyvesant
miserably.  "Please don't tell her we
were watching her, will you, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Aw,&mdash;why not!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Please</i>, John!"  Stuyvesant's voice was
earnest.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I won't," agreed John in a disappointed
way.  "But I do like to tease her!
She's awfully cunning when she gets excited,
and you can get a rise out of her every time."
</p>

<p>
After that they settled to play rum for a
small stake.  Stuyvesant was absent.  Time
and again John and the cards faded while he
saw Cecilia sitting before an open fire,&mdash;soft
in the firelight, gentle,&mdash;almost ready to smile
on him.  His picture? ... Probably scorning
him,&mdash;but,&mdash;at least she'd thought of him
for that little space.  He looked toward the
chair, and he saw her gently smile in his
direction.
</p>

<p>
"Rum!" yelled John, much delighted.  "That
puts me out.  Gee, you're in the clouds!  You
owe me forty-nine cents."

CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
THE MYSTERY
</h3>

<p>
The rectory hall was quiet, although it was
well filled with people&mdash;shabby, the most of
them, and sitting uneasily upright in their
chairs.  Damp snow clung to the coat of one
woman who had just entered, and the smell of
dirty and wet clothing was in the air.
</p>

<p>
Now and again the steam pounded in a low
radiator below a window.  There was a great
deal of sniffing, and a hacking cough from a
woman who bragged of a "weak chest."  At
last an old man who had been fingering the
brim of his hat spoke in a hoarse whisper.
"How <i>is</i> he?" he croaked.  His thumb pointed
over his shoulder toward the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't no better," responded the woman
who coughed.  "<i>She</i> come down a half hour
ago an' sez 'He's the same.'"  The woman
coughed again, and afterward wiped her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"He gimme a pipe," said the old man, turning
the hat in his hands.  "It hez a real amber
mouthpiece on.  He sez, 'Here, Jake, you know
a good pipe, now I don't.  This here was gave
to me, I want you should hev it,' he sez,&mdash;like
that he sez&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I bet!" said a frightened looking little man,
hitherto silent, "I bet he did!  What he done
fer me&mdash;&mdash;!"  The little man stopped, looked
around, and cowered back in is chair, swallowed
several times, then spoke in a high voice,
evidently unnatural and the fruit of great
effort.  "I was in the penitentiary," he said, "an'
when I come out no one would gimme a job.
I was despert.  I got my wife, an' her aunt,
what's had a stroke, an' can't use her limbs no
way.  My wife took to coughin' an' couldn't
work no more.  Gawd, it was fierce!  I was
despert.  I come to him.  What he done fer
me&mdash;&mdash;!  I sez 'What kin I do?  I gotta feed
them women.  Hev I gotta steal again?'  He
sez no, an' he set me down an' gimme a meal.
Talkin' to me while I et ... Gawd, I never
kin fergit it....  That there meal was none of
them cold potato hand-outs served up with
a sneer.  Human beings is awful rough with
each other sometimes.  When I got through
I got up.  I sez, 'I don't want no more.  I
guess I kin hunt my own job now, fer you've
made me a man agin....'  He sez, 'Well,
well,' an' then he set me down, an' believe it or
not, he gimme a c<i>ee</i>gar!  A fie' center too!
Then he come with me to my old woman, and
Aunt Ellen, an' he seen that they was did for,
an' the next week he got me a job at the
cement plant."  After he finished he cowered
again.  The world had shown him little
forgiveness.  His world was scorn, or a hidden
shame.
</p>

<p>
The little man had, in telling of Father
McGowan's goodness, voiced his crucifixion.  The
pain of telling it made him feel as if he were
at last thanking the big priest adequately....
He blinked, and avoided his companions' eyes
now.  He knew what to expect.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad he helped yuh," said the old man,
"but he would.  There ain't nothing he
wouldn't do fer nobody."
</p>

<p>
Common sorrow, like common joy, had
drawn these people together.  The love of the
man upstairs had filled their souls, and left no
room for littleness.  The little man of the
penitentiary was one of them, not an outcast.
</p>

<p>
He sat up straight again, still blinking.
"Yer right," he said; "he's helped a lot of us
to believe there is a Gawd ...  an' something
beside hell, livin' or dead."
</p>

<p>
"Yep," answered the woman with the cough.
She drew a shawl close about her and moved
near the clanking radiator.  "Ain't it cold?"
she said.  "I'm used to settin' near the stove.
I wisht she'd come.  That there woman in
white, I mean, the one what nurses him."
</p>

<p>
"I wish too," said a fat soul who surveyed
every one with suspicion.  "I gotta get home
an' pack my man's dinner pail.  Night work
he does.  It ain't so nice.  <i>I</i> don't get no
company.  All day long he snores, an' at night I
set home, or go alone.  We used to go to
pictures every Monday regular as clockwork."
</p>

<p>
"He helped me buy a parlour organ," said
a thin woman a little apart from the group.
"I come to him, and I sez, 'I'd go hungry to
get a organ, what I could pick out tunes on,
an' mebbe learn to play "Home, Sweet Home"
on.'  He sez, 'Well, well!' (yuh know his way)
an' then I told him how I'd wanted one, an'
saved up, and then had to use that there money
to bury pop (his insurance havin' ran out)
an' he helped me.  I got it.  I kin play three
measures a 'Home, Sweet Home,' real good,
except fer being slow in the bass....  There
ain't nothing like music fer company.  I don't
get lonely no more of evenings.  I use to get
that down, an' tired a settin' alone after work,
that I'd hate to hear the six a'clock whistles.
It ain't no joke, settin' in one room with the
wall paper all off.  I wonder how he is?" she
ended in another voice.  No one answered.
The woman near the radiator coughed, then
wiped her eyes.  The old man twirled his hat.
</p>

<p>
A girl with a sullen look slunk in, and
settled near the door.  There was quiet.  Once
in a while a chair was moved, and grated on the
floor.  The radiator clanked.  There was the
staccato tap of heels in the upper hall, then on
the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i> ask her," said one woman to another.
</p>

<p>
The old man spoke.  "Mrs.," he said, "how <i>is</i>
he?"
</p>

<p>
"There ain't no change," said Mrs. Fry,
"and there ain't no sense to your settin' here."
</p>

<p>
"We'll be quiet," said the old man wistfully,
"and we'd kinda like to.  We all love him."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fry covered her face with her handkerchief.
"Set if yuh want to," she said in
what was, for her, a softened tone, "but there
ain't a bit a sense to it."  Then she turned
and went down the hall, blowing her nose
loudly.
</p>

<p>
"There's three doctors," said a girl just out
of childhood, and yet from her place in life
old looking.
</p>

<p>
"I know that," replied the thin woman.  "It
looks bad fer him, but he <i>can't</i> die!  There ain't
another!"
</p>

<p>
"He won't die!" said the old man.  "Fer
them that knowed him, he'll always live."
</p>

<p>
In the kitchen Mrs. Fry was sobbing in the
roller towel.  She heard Father McGowan's
voice come, as it had, in gasps.  "Now,&mdash;now!
Mrs. Fry&mdash;&mdash;" echoed in her heart, "don't
feel badly&mdash;I'm tired,&mdash;and&mdash;I'm ready to
go&mdash;to sleep&mdash;&mdash;"  And then he had smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Fry," came in a voice from the doorway,
"yer wanted!"  She looked up to see an
old man with the tears running down his face
and following the wrinkles in criss-cross paths
of salty moisture.
</p>

<p>
The nurse stood in the hall.  She alone was
calm.  "You'd better go now," she said quietly
to the little group.  Several of them sobbed
loudly.  The door opened suddenly.  "Where's
Father McGowan?" called a little boy.  "I
got a new kitty what I want to show him.
<i>Ain't</i> he in?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was on her knees in the dark, by her
bed.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan," she whispered, "oh,
Father McGowan-<i>dear</i>, where are you?"  He
had not gone where childhood had had an Irish
mother go.  Growing had made the mystery&mdash;the
vast uncertainty&mdash;the haunting question of
the still, dark hours!
</p>

<p>
Cecilia lifted her face.  Her eyes were dry.
"Oh, God," she said aloud, "if you are, give
us another life.  There is no possible
good-bye for little human hearts that love.  Oh,
God, let me see Father McGowan-dear again.
Oh, let me!  I will be good all my life, if I
may meet him once again&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She stopped, choked.
</p>

<p>
The mystery echoed....  "Father
McGowan-dear," she whispered, "where <i>are</i>
you?  Dearest, <i>where</i> have you gone, and
why?"
</p>

CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
A RELAPSE
</h3>

<p>
"He died," said Johnny, "of pneumonia.
One of those quick cases, you know.  Cecilia's
frightfully broken up&mdash;you can see it&mdash;although
she doesn't say anything."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw much in him," said John
musingly, "but he had an awful hold on a lot of
people."
</p>

<p>
"Your sister cared for him, didn't she?"
asked Stuyvesant, then added bravely, "I think
that assures his being unusual."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know," said John in a lazy
way; "girls are queer,&mdash;sometimes sentimental.
He was good to her when she was tiny.  She
always remembers things like that.  I think
she's kinda sentimental."
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant looked peculiar and grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Saw Tommy Dixon down town to-day,"
said John.  A sudden flush spread across
Stuyvesant's face.  His eyes were unpleasantly
bitter.  "Good sport," continued John.
</p>

<p>
"I disagree," said Stuyvesant loudly.
"Don't like him, nor his rotten code."  John
looked on Stuyvesant speculatively.  He
reflected that, after all, Stuyv didn't know it
all, and that if he wore a cassock he might
have been taken for Father McGowan.  His
ideals were very similar.
</p>

<p>
"Can't train with a Sunday school class,"
said John.  "Live while you're here, yuh know.
Damned if I haven't been good lately!"
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant was worried.  Thus far his work
had been easy, because of John's adoring
following.  But,&mdash;were John to follow Tommy
Dixon with the same adoration,&mdash;then,&mdash;it
<i>would</i> be work!  He thought, with an inward
sneer, of the smallness of the boy's measures
for life.  He thought of his always following
the new, and of his weak swaying, and then he
thought of who had asked his help.
</p>

<p>
"Come to dinner with me, John," he said,
while he made mental arrangement for the
cancelling of another engagement.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind," answered the old John, in his
old tired-of-life manner.  "Got a date before
dinner.  Where'll I meet you?"  Stuyvesant
named a club, and they parted.  Stuyvesant
went to his office.  There were several
matters awaiting his attention, but he pushed
them aside.  Across the room he saw Tommy
Dixon's insolent face.  On it was the ever-present
smile, that which shaded into a leer too
easily....  "She says she can't forget his
kisses," came with a touch of flame across his
tortured brain.
</p>

<p>
"God!" said K. Stuyvesant.  "God!" He
hid his eyes with his hands.  His breath came
fast.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was half after eight, and John was to
have met him at eight.  Stuyvesant looked at
his watch, and frowned.  The day had been
hard, and had left small capacity for
patience....  The mention of Tommy Dixon had
brought back a misery he'd hoped somewhat
dulled (one remembered by a stern control of
thought, usually not more than once a day).
</p>

<p>
Now John, after Stuyvesant's breaking an
engagement,&mdash;was late.  His casual acceptance
of Stuyvesant's hospitality brought a
smile to that gentleman's lips.  He wondered
if John thought he courted the opportunity of
hearing his rather young, and too often callow,
opinions stated with absolute assurance as
truths?
</p>

<p>
At nine Stuyvesant shut his watch with a
snap, and went out alone to dinner.  He was
entirely out of humour.  He allowed himself
to meditate largely on Tommy Dixon.  It was
torture&mdash;exactly fitted his mood, and helped.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Celie," said Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
Celie stopped playing the chimes of a new
"piece" of Jeremiah's pattern.
</p>

<p>
"Celie," he went on, "I done that you asked."
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Van Dorn?" she asked in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Jeremiah.  He blew his
nose loudly.  "<i>He</i> asked me, an' he asked me,"
Jeremiah explained, "an' I was that uppish!
Jeremiah,' he'd say, 'don't try to cast yourself
for God.  It won't work,' an' I'd say, 'Is
it going to rain, Father McGowan?'  Just
the last time he come I seen him in the hall, an'
he was pleadin' with me; he sez, 'You can
control his work.  See that he does no harm, but
don't do more,' an' I sez, 'It's snowin' now,
ain't it?'  Oh, dear Lordy!  Ain't life one mess
of regrets!  One after the other, spoilin' your
digestion, an' makin' yuh kick around of
nights! ... I loved him too."
</p>

<p>
"Dear," said Cecilia, "he knew that!"
</p>

<p>
"Yuh think so, Celie?" asked Jeremiah
wistfully.  "Oh, yes!" she answered.  Her answer
held an applied genuineness.  It convinced
Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
"I give him back his rotten little factory (I
was losin' money on it, anyway), and I wrote
him a letter.  I sez, 'Dear Sir&mdash;&mdash;'  An' I went
on telling him Father McGowan an' Gawd
done it, not me.  I sez I was his well-wisher
now, wishin' him all success, an' I sez not to
get funny in the hospital business on sick kids
no more or I'd have him jailed.  The letter
was friendly and Christian, all owing to Father
McGowan, who doesn't know it&mdash;God rest his
soul!"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was smiling tremulously.  "You
absolute darling!" she said.  She perched on the
arm of his chair, and they sat in silence.
</p>

<p>
"After all," she said, "hurting this little man
wouldn't bring mamma her pink roses, would
it, dear?"
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah's eyes snapped.  In them was the
look that certain competitors, who scorned him
socially, dreaded.  "It brung me mine," he
stated; "it brung me mine!"  Cecilia laughed.
A sudden lightness of spirit, like the flash of
day into dawn, was hers.
</p>

<p>
"Dear," she said, "I believe Father
McGowan knows!  I believe he does!"  Jeremiah
kissed her and smoothed her golden hair with
his hand which would never become smooth.
"You're like your maw," he said.  It was his
greatest tribute.  Cecilia clung to him with a
pathetic hunger.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Cecilia, the telephone," said the
pompous person from the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; yes, sir," answered Jeremiah,
"she's a-coming."  Cecilia went to an adjoining
room.  After her "yes" things swayed a bit.
She did not need his voice, which said, "This
is Stuyvesant Twombly."  She knew.  "Yes,"
she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>have</i> to bother you," he said.  "I've just
had a message from John.  He's been a little
hurt&mdash;just a little, Miss Cecilia, and he wants
you to come with me to where he is.  He's a
little hurt.  You won't worry?  I'll stop for
you in a moment, that is, if you'll come?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course!" she answered; "but you're
sure he's not really hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered.  "Do up well.  It's
cold."  She hung up the receiver, and stood a
minute, hand over her thudding heart.  She
was not thinking of John.
</p>

<p>
As for Stuyvesant, he hung up the receiver
and swore loudly.  He was thinking of the
'phone message which had come from John,
and of John's small sister.  "Stuyv," he had
heard John say, "I'm up here at the Eagles'
View House.  I had a bust-up.  Get Celie and
come.  I'm dying&mdash;&mdash;"  There had been a lull.
"He's fainted," had come across the wires in
another tone.  Stuyvesant's first amusement
over the last 'phone message faded suddenly.
Perhaps John had made the supreme effort and
had managed to speak those few words?  Then
he abandoned speculation and telephoned
Cecilia.  He had assured her that John was not
much hurt....  The gentle care of her was
instinctive.  If John were right the other would
come later.
</p>

<p>
With a doctor in the car they drew up before
the Madden House.  The chauffeur was not
off his seat before Stuyvesant was out and on
the steps.  "Are you warmly enough dressed?"
he asked of her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank you.  John?" she questioned.
</p>

<p>
"He telephoned me that he had a smash-up
and that he wanted you.  I have a doctor; he
may have some sprains or bruises," said Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"It's so good of you," she responded.  All
of Marjory's hints had gone.  She felt his hand
on her arm and felt from it a sweet sickness.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Cecilia, may I introduce Doctor Holt?
Miss Madden&mdash;&mdash;"  After that she settled,
and felt rugs being wrapped around her.
Stuyvesant's hands lingered.  They held a
thrilling tenderness.  "Are they well around
you?" he asked.  Cecilia said they were, and
Stuyvesant drew a long breath.  The doctor
looked from one to the other speculatively.  He
judged them lovers and himself in the way.
The girl was certainly entirely lovely&mdash;the
soft type who asked for gentleness in return
for unbounded love.  The way she looked at
young Twombly as he stared straight ahead
was rather beautiful, thought the doctor.  She
jumped as he spoke.  "These gay young men
and their speeding," he had said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Cecilia, "aren't they fearful?
I think they should be reared without silly
sisters to worry over them!"
</p>

<p>
The doctor agreed.  He imagined young
Madden to be a hard-muscled fellow who liked
sport.  In speaking of speed, his only thought
had been mileage.
</p>

<p>
The car had left the city and was running
with difficulty over a road which was bad from
a light snow.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Madden is skidding quite a bit (pardon
me, Miss Madden) alone on that back seat.
You'd better get back there, Mr. Twombly,"
said the doctor.  He smiled.  He thought he
had done something very kind, and done it
neatly.  Mr. Twombly stuttered something
that sounded like, "I'm glad; I'd be
glad&mdash;pleased&mdash;&mdash;"  Cecilia stared agonizedly ahead.
The car made a turn, and, alone on the broad
seat, she swayed, slid half across the seat,
bumped.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant turned his chair.  "May I, Miss
Cecilia, or the doctor?  We're going so fast.
You'll be so jolted."  In answer she turned back
the rug, and Stuyvesant settled by her.  After
that there was quiet.  Cecilia looked ahead,
through steamed glass, at the ears of
Stuyvesant's chauffeur.  Stuyvesant sneakingly
looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Only ten," said the doctor; "we're making
good time."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon?" said Stuyvesant, and at the same
time from Cecilia, "Excuse me.  I didn't
hear."  Under cover of the dark the doctor smiled.
Cecilia flushed, and Stuyvesant bit his lip.  He
clasped his hands together very tightly, for he
was afraid that if she looked toward him he
would put his arms around her and draw her
close.
</p>

<p>
The doctor began to criticise the administration,
as people always do when they know little
of the facts.  Stuyvesant clutched the straw,
and argued hotly first on one side, and then
the other.  The doctor was pleased, for
K. Stuyvesant was illustrating a pet theory of his,
universal insanity.  "Now if Van Dorn could
hear this!" he reflected.  "Why, the man could
be locked up!  He's much worse than millions
in asylums!"
</p>

<p>
The car jolted, and turned.  Cecilia swayed,
and bumped against Stuyvesant's arm.  It
slipped back of her protectingly, and closed
around her.  "That was a jolt&mdash;" he said
shortly, "these roads,&mdash;did it jar you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Cecilia, "thank you."  His
arm had been pulled away with a jerk.  Cecilia
stared ahead at the chauffeur's ears.  They
were large and floppy, and the whole world
seemed like them, a misfit.  She felt chilled,
alone, afraid.  She wished the car would jolt
again.  She wished so brazenly.  She didn't
care,&mdash;she did!
</p>

<p>
At the Eagles' View Cecilia was ushered
up creaking stairs to a cheap, little room.  It
was shabby, and hung with soiled cretonnes.
There were pictures on the walls, entitled "The
Bathers,"&mdash;"Playful Kittens,"&mdash;"A Surprise!"  Some
more lurid with titles impossible.
Stuyvesant had followed Cecilia and from the
doorway, over her head, he caught the impression.
He had expected it, but it hurt cruelly.
His spirit was a mixture of longing to press
her face against his shoulder, and a great
hankering to kick John.
</p>

<p>
"I'm dying!" gasped John.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest!" said Cecilia, and caught her
breath sharply, then she slipped to her knees
by the bed.  She put her arm beneath his head,
which was too low, and turned to Stuyvesant.
"Where is the doctor?" she asked.  At that
moment he appeared in the doorway.  "Well,
young man," he, said, "speeding?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to die," answered John in gasps.
Cecilia had grown very white.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" said the doctor.  "Now if you
people will just leave us for a few
moments&mdash;&mdash;"  He began to open his case as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Want me?" asked Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"No," he was answered; "you take care of
Miss Madden."  The door opened and a girl
appeared.  Her hair was streaked from bleach,
and dark at the roots; her expression insolently
daring.
</p>

<p>
"How yuh feel, honey boy?" she asked of
John.  John turned away his face.  He looked
sicker.
</p>

<p>
"One of your friends?" questioned Cecilia.
John did not answer.  "Yes," replied the girl.
"I'm Miss LeMain.  Me and John have been
pals for this long while."
</p>

<p>
"I'm John's sister," said Cecilia, and held
out her hand.  Miss LeMain took it with a
limp and high gesture cultivated as
"elegant."  "Pleased to meet yuh," she murmured, and
then, "I'm glad you've came.  My nerves is
that shook up!  Mebbe the gent'man would
get us something to drink.  My nerves is all
shook.  I feel fierce."
</p>

<p>
They descended the rickety stairs, the girls
followed by Stuyvesant.  If John had been
well something would have happened to him.
As it was Stuyvesant was fiercely protective of
the small sister in a curt, silent way.  His anger
was almost overpowering....  He thought of
Cecilia on her knees in that evil room.  He
thought of her gentle treatment of Miss
LeMain....  He was humbled by her sweetness,
and furious from its cause.
</p>

<p>
"Is he your gent'man friend?" asked Miss
LeMain while Stuyvesant ordered the drink.
Cecilia shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Thought he was.  Seems like a cute fellah.
Gawd, my nerves is shook!  Jacky speeds so!
I sez, 'Jack, you'll do this trick once too often!'
an' he sez, 'I'm running this boat, girlie,' an'
I sez some more, an' then he kissed me; yuh
know what a kidder he is!  An' the car a-running
like that!  Then the next thing she was
over, an' I was in a field.  Jack was somewhere
in the road.  This ain't the <i>first</i> accident
I been in.  I believe in a short life an' a merry
one.  All my gent'men friends has cars.  No
Fords neither.  I hope Jacky ain't suffering.
He's a sweet boy, an' some sport!"  Cecilia's
hands were locked tightly together in her lap.
Her eyes were tragic.  "My nerves is shook up
fierce!" echoed Miss LeMain.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant had appeared in time to hear
the last of the recital.  "You'd better go lie
down," he said decidedly.  "It will do you
good, and Miss Madden needs quiet."
</p>

<p>
"An' 'two's company, three's a crowd!' ain't
that it?" questioned Miss LeMain with a
giggle.  Her sally was not greeted with
enthusiasm.  She left, terming Stuyvesant a
grouch, and Cecilia sweet, but lacking pep.
</p>

<p>
Alone, Stuyvesant stood looking down at
Cecilia.  His arm was on the mantel.  The
shadows and lights from an open fireplace
played on them.  The rest of the room in half
dark brought them close.  Constraint was
impossible because of the situation and Cecilia's
dependence on Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"The money came too quickly," she said
meeting his eyes.  "John has to spend it in the
way that makes the most noise.  I&mdash;I am so
tired of it!  So bruised by it!  I wish we were
back in that little flat, with John laying bricks
as my father did.  Perhaps then he would be
a good man.  That is everything to me."
</p>

<p>
"He is going to be a good man, Cecilia," said
Stuyvesant.  Neither noticed the use of her
first name.  "He will be a good man.  This is
a relapse,&mdash;a recurrence of growing pains.
There are good things in him.  When he's
awake he has a sense of humour.  That is a darn
good thing to have, you know.  I think, next
to God, it's the best thing a man can own."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia pressed her handkerchief against her
lips.  "You will help him again?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Stuyvesant.  He put out his
hand in pledge and hers was swallowed in his
huge grasp.  At the touch of her hand he
gasped, "Cecilia!" but she did not answer, for
the doctor's step was heard on the rickety
stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Two broken ribs," he said; "scratch on his
arm.  Now we'll take him home.  He'll probably
yell over the bumps, but I judge the yells
will do him good.  Where's his companion?
Send another car for her, or take her along?"
</p>

<p>
"Send for her," said Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"No," disagreed Cecilia, "if you don't mind,
we'll take her.  I think it would be
better."  Stuyvesant looked annoyed, but sent the oily
proprietor to call the lady of the
shook-up-nerves.  She descended immediately, wrapped
in a large fur coat, and with a cerise motor
scarf about her head.  "I couldn't get no rest,"
she called; "I'm all fussy.  How's Jacky darling?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>She</i> isn't going with us?" said John at the
top of the stairs.  He stopped and leaned
heavily on Stuyvesant.  "My God!" he exploded.
"Stuyv, she <i>can't</i>!  Celie can't meet her!  She
can't!  Tell her we'll send a car.  I don't want
Celie to see her."
</p>

<p>
"They've been talking for half an hour,"
said Stuyvesant.  "Your sister insists on
taking her in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord!" said John.  "Oh, Lord!"
</p>

<p>
"Come along!" said Stuyvesant roughly.
</p>

<p>
"I really thought I was dying," said John
in a shamed way.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" ordered Stuyvesant.  "You make
me sick!"  They went down with no more
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, dear?" asked Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Celie!" said John.  He reached for her
hand and clung to it.  "Oh, Celie!" he echoed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Until dawn Stuyvesant relived the night.
The ride home had made the deepest impression.
A girl with a painted soul and face had
chattered loudly, and with a cheap sentiment
reeking in her talk.  She had spoken often
of "Jacky darling."
</p>

<p>
While Jacky darling, from shame and pain,
had groaned in deep, shaky groans, his head
had lain on his sister's shoulder.  On the other
side Stuyvesant had sat.  The doctor had
disposed of the case as typical, and was thinking
of an article which he'd just read in the <i>Medical
Journal</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Dearie," Fanchette LeMain had said, "your
fur's open."  She had reached toward Cecilia's
throat, but Stuyvesant reached first.  He
fastened the clasp with shaking hands, and the
back of one hand touched her chin.  Then he
had sunk back to dream his impossible dreams,
and wonder why she should have cared.  He
knew he was a duffer!  But he was almost sure
that she once had cared,&mdash;for him.

CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
FORGIVENESS
</h3>

<p>
"Celie," said John, "honestly he was devilish
to me, and I deserved it!"  John was lying
on a lounge, covered and looking wan.  The
library fire burned cheerfully, and the portrait
of an Irish mother smiled down on Cecilia and
John.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant Twombly had just left.  He had
uttered some scathing truths.
</p>

<p>
"He said I was a 'callow pup,'" said John.
"He said I shouldn't have called you to that
place if I'd been half dead.  Cecilia dear, he
was right.  Celie, forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
"Dearest!" said Cecilia.  She sank to her
knees by the lounge, and pressed John's face
to hers.  He felt her tears.
</p>

<p>
"I never will again!" he said huskily.  "God
help me!"  She didn't reply.  She couldn't, but
only pressed him closer.
</p>

<p>
"I can't bear to see you take the tawdry and
cheap," she whispered at length, "for, John
dear, it does crowd out the real.  I know it
does."
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me," he ordered.  She turned her face,
and then the door opened.
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon," said Stuyvesant uncomfortably,
"I thought you were alone."  Cecilia
had gotten to her feet, and stood, shy
and flushing adorably.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia's been weeping over the prodigal
pup," explained John.  "I told her I was sorry.
I am.  If you and she will give me another
chance&mdash;&mdash;"  He held out his hand with his
words, and Stuyvesant took it.
</p>

<p>
"I came back to say I was sorry I was so
darn brutal," he said, squeezing John's hand,
"but I'm afraid I meant it all."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia left them with a word or two.  At
the door she turned.  Stuyvesant was looking
after her, oblivious to John's presence.
</p>

<p>
"Celie's tears," said John, using a handkerchief
on his cheeks.  He recalled the new leaf,
and added, "Three or four of mine too, I
guess."  His expression was sheepish, but
that vanished, for in Stuyvesant's face was
approval.  "John," said Stuyvesant, "you're <i>all</i>
right!"
</p>

<p>
John coughed.  The genuine gruffness of
Stuyvesant unsettled him.  "I'm awfully glad
you came back," said John.  "You'll stay?
Let's play rum."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
SPRING
</h3>

<p>
"What are <i>you</i> doing here?" Stuyvesant
asked of Annette.  Considerable surprise was
in his face and voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," answered Annette, "I have been telling
Cecilia Madden that I was a pig.  I asked
her to forgive me.  I feel much better!"
</p>

<p>
They had met on the long drive that ran on
the inland side of the Sound house, toward the
main road.
</p>

<p>
"I'm stopping at a house up the road for
Sunday," explained Annette.  "Cecilia wanted
to motor me back, but I needed air.  Indigestion
and conscience are so much alike.  You
want to breathe deeply after the easing of
both."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed K. Stuyvesant absently.
"How could you ever dislike her, Annette?"
</p>

<p>
"She came into school," said Annette, "the
rawest little person you ever saw.  I felt the
injustice of her having money, while I, who
knew so well how to use it, had to scrimp and
save.  I saw her with everything in the world
that would have put me into heaven and she
was miserably unhappy.  It was my first taste
of injustice.  I hated it.  I never was a
resigned person, you know, Stuyv."
</p>

<p>
"How did the girls treat her?" asked
Stuyvesant.  He was becoming gruff.
</p>

<p>
"We put her through a refined form of
hell," answered Annette, "the cruelties of
which were only possible for the feminine mind
to evolve.  Stuyv, <i>do</i> look what you're doing!
The gardener will be grateful to you!"
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant had been switching a cane
viciously.  He had taken off many heads of
a particularly dressed-up variety of tulip.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be darned!" he said, looking at them
with surprise.  "Couldn't you see how dear
and all that kind of thing she was?" he queried
farther.  "I don't see how even a set of
simpering, half-witted, idiotic, jealous girls could
<i>help</i> seeing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So you're in love with her?" interrupted
Annette.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant looked on his cousin with
surprise.  Then he answered.  "Of course," he
said, "but how'd you know?"
</p>

<p>
Annette laughed.  After her laughter she
slipped a hand through his arm.  "Stuyvesant,"
she said, "your soul and mine are cut
from a different pattern.  It was always hard
for me to understand you, but something has
happened lately which has made me larger,
much decenter.  Stuyvesant, I want a long
talk&mdash;a heart-to-heart effect.  Will you walk
back with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be glad to know," she went on, "that
after Cecilia had pneumonia she was quite the
idol of the school.  There was one of those
complete shifts so characteristic of our
American youth, and every one liked her but me.
She used to try to make me like her with the
most transparent little appeals.  Heavens, I
was a devil!  She sent me violets at one time
when I had a cold, and I gave them to the
maid, and then spoke loudly before her of
unwelcome attentions and social climbers."
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant was walking in jerks.  His arm
beneath Annette's was rigid.
</p>

<p>
"She's forgiven me," said Annette, smiling.
</p>

<p>
He relaxed.  "I am a darn fool!" he said,
"but honestly&mdash;&mdash;!"  He stopped and shook
his head.
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't she care for you?" asked Annette;
"turned you down?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't asked her.  She's shown very
plainly what she thinks of me."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!" said Annette shortly.  "No man
in love is a judge of anything!  He only knows
that she has blue eyes, or he can't just
remember, maybe they're brown, but anyway they're
beautiful!"  Annette's cousin grinned sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"What colour are they?" asked Annette.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, but I guess they're brown.
I know they're unusual, now aren't they, Annette?"
</p>

<p>
Annette giggled.  "Very ordinary," she
answered, "and they happen to be blue."
</p>

<p>
"They're not ordinary.  You know they
aren't!  It doesn't make any difference to me,
of course.  I'm not in love with her looks, but
they're <i>not</i> ordinary!"
</p>

<p>
"It is not like you," said the girl, "to give
up anything you want in that half-hearted
way.  I don't quite understand, Stuyvesant."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;&mdash;" he began, then stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" questioned Annette.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't give it up without being sure.  Her
friend Marjory, well, she made me see a few
things."  He was staring moodily ahead.  A
car whizzed by, leaving a trail of dust.
"Damn!" said Stuyvesant.  Annette laughed.
"You see now if I asked her," he continued,
"I'd lose my chance of seeing her.  I don't
suppose you or any one else could know what
that means to me!"
</p>

<p>
"You might not lose it.  I don't trust the
green-eyed lady.  I never have."
</p>

<p>
"But she's Cecilia's best friend," objected
Stuyvesant, "and why would she do anything
to hurt her?"
</p>

<p>
"I used to think you posed," she answered
despairingly.  "Now I imagine it is only
feeble-mindedness.  Take my advice, Stuyvesant:
<i>Ask</i> her!  The other course is so spineless."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know what I'd lose!"
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't lose it!"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't?" he repeated.  "Excuse me,
Annette, but really you don't know what
you're talking about.  I do.  I know too
well."  His voice had become bitter.  She looked at
him and saw that in the year past he had
changed greatly.
</p>

<p>
"And now about you?" he said in a changed
way.  "Are you still set on this working
business?  I hope you aren't.  I honestly want to
help.  It worries me like thunder!"
</p>

<p>
"You're a dear!" responded Annette, "and
that is quite a tale.  Can't we sit on this wall?
Whose is it? ... The Maddens own all this?
Heavens!"
</p>

<p>
She perched on the wall and he lit a cigarette.
"No, not now," she answered as he held
out the case.  "The small Saint Cecilia doesn't,
does she?  Well, she couldn't.  She might
revert to the cob pipe."  It was a flash of the old
Annette.  Stuyvesant looked unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
"My tale&mdash;" said Annette.  "You know
mamma is a worshipper of the long-haired.
Any one who can create <i>anything</i>&mdash;futurist
painters, pianists, the inventor of a new
cocktail.  You know her, Stuyv."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," admitted Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what with their bleeding and papa's
insane investments, he never provided properly
for us, Stuyv.  Mamma used to go to him and
really cry!  It was pathetic!  And all he
would say was that he had no money."
</p>

<p>
"He hadn't," answered Annette's cousin.
</p>

<p>
"I'd expect you to sympathise," she said.
"You men always do, but that isn't my story.
When he died his affairs were in such fearful
shape that mamma and I were terribly pinched.
She never liked you, Stuyv, or she might have
asked your advice.  As it was, she invested in
lovely nut groves in southern California.  The
promoters quite misrepresented them; they
didn't pay at all or declare dividends or
whatever they do.  In fact they assessed the owners
of the common stock for irrigation or
something like that.  I don't just understand
business.  About that time I met Dicky Fanshawe,
who doesn't do anything original&mdash;only
works&mdash;fearfully poor.  I fell in love with him, but
mamma saw me as the mistress of some gilt and
pink salon, with a long-haired genius as a
husband, and was simply devilish about Dicky.
You know her, Stuyv."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Stuyvesant.  "I do."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know the Altshine failure took
us in too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered.  "I know.  Why were
you so stiff-necked about my help, Annette?
I have enough to help you all you need, and
I want to.  You know it."
</p>

<p>
"Mamma has never liked you," said Annette,
"but when the crash came, well, she was willing
to live on you.  For the same reason I was
not.  I know you disapprove of me.  My
ideals are not many, but under the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"You make me feel an awful dub!" said
Stuyvesant.  "I haven't any right to
disapprove of you or be lofty."
</p>

<p>
"But you do.  Well, mamma saw me retrieving
the family fortune in some romantic and
bohemian manner.  I was to create something,
a book, or be a decorator for the smart, a
reader of East Indian poems.  She had splendid
ideas, but the fact is, I've found, you have
to have a hint of something inside to do
anything successfully outside.  I hadn't it.
</p>

<p>
"I descended to a social secretary and
chaperoning that horrid woman's nasty little white
pups, and from that mamma has consented to
my marrying Dicky.  He only has ten thousand
a year, and I'm going to marry him on
that!  I love him terribly!  Isn't it splendidly
romantic?"
</p>

<p>
"Um," grunted Stuyvesant.  "Annette," he
said, "I want you to let me provide for your
mother.  You will? ... No, don't thank me.
It irritates me.  Oh, please!"  After his last
plea she stopped her effusive thanks and
pressed his arm.  Suddenly she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What are you laughing at?" asked Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia advocated pink for the poor," Annette
explained, "and I never understood how
they felt until my terrible employer asked me
not to wear frills.  She said they weren't suitable
for my position!  It's all so relative, isn't
it?  Cecilia saw the panorama.  I saw only my
corner."
</p>

<p>
Annette slipped from the wall.  "Must go,"
she said.  "Dicky's coming out at eight.  You
want me to be happy?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Stuyvesant.  Annette's
face changed.  "Stuyv," she said, "it's
everything when you find the one who fits your
heart and mind....  <i>Ask</i> her.  Please, Stuyv.
I can't believe she doesn't care."
</p>

<p>
"You're awfully good," he answered huskily.
"Lord, Annette!  If you were right&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
Annette stepped near him.  For the first time
since the nursery days she kissed him.  "Stay
here," she ordered, "and think it out.  Bye!"  With
a wave she left.  At the first turn in
the road she looked back.  Her cousin was
still sitting on the wall, and he was staring
intently at the cigarette between his fingers.
Annette had seen that it had gone out before
she started.
</p>

<p>
"Poor boy!" she said.  "Poor boy!" and then
she thought of Dicky, who had turned her hard
little heart softer to all the world.  She forgot
the "poor boy" who sat alone on the wall.  She
forgot money and things, the two which had
mattered most to her, and once had been her
life.  With a new look on her face, she dreamed
of a future&mdash;a future at which she once would
have laughed.
</p>

<p>
Hers was the spirit that puts glory into the
face of the tired mother in the overcrowded
flat; beauty into the face of the tawdry little
girl who sits on a park bench with her "gentleman
friend"; youth into age, waiting for soft
and endless night; a little touch of God, a hint
of something larger, veiled for eyes too young;
the proof intangible, sublime.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
PULLING OFF THE THORNS
</h3>

<p>
The heat of June in the city drew forth a
hot, damp steam.  It made white faces and
brought to mind sunstrokes, not June's
country thought&mdash;roses.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, it's hot!" said John.  He sat opposite
Stuyvesant Twombly in a restaurant famed
for its coolness.  "Come out with me
to-night!" he added.  "Dad and Celie will be
glad to have you, too.  Come on!  Awful nice
and cool out there."
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant answered absently, and smiled a
little as he did.  The idea of "Celie's" being
glad to see him amused, even while it hurt, him
desperately.  He thought with a cankered
humour of his trying to find out whether there
was a spark of hope for him, after the talk
with Annette had made his dreams too daring,
and had made him need, all over again, proof
of how little he mattered.  He had gotten the
proof.  His first talk had been full of
Marjory,&mdash;Marjory,&mdash;Marjory.  He had not
wanted to talk of Marjory.  Again he had
hated her for coming between them.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia had told of what Marjory's letters
had held,&mdash;how dear Marjory was (Cecilia
had been a bit breathless at this point)&mdash;how
she, Cecilia, loved her,&mdash;where Marjory was,&mdash;where
she was going.  It had been a very surface
talk, not once touching anything personal,
at least no more than the small Cecilia's great
love for her friend.  Then John had appeared
and Cecilia had excused herself with much
relief and gone quickly away.
</p>

<p>
It was as always, her avoidance, and what
in a less sweet nature would have shown as
marked distaste.  Stuyvesant had understood,
and held on to his small privilege doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll leave," Stuyvesant heard John
say; he didn't know what had come before,
"but I'll get home from school often and see
you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going away myself for a while," said
Stuyvesant,&mdash;"I don't know just where.  I'm
tired of business,&mdash;everything.  I guess I need
a change."  He thought miserably of the
"change" he needed, and then shut his heart
on her sweet image.  He made up his mind to
stop thinking of "that kind of thing," and his
heart laughed at his decision.
</p>

CECILIA STOPPED AND GASPED. IT WAS HARDER <br />
THAN SHE HAD DREAMED
</p>

<p>
"Stuyv!" said John aghast, "what am I
going to do without you?  Why, Stuyv!  You
can't go, at least for long.  You don't mean
a long trip?"
</p>

<p>
"'Fraid so," he was answered.  "I guess I'd
better, John.  I&mdash;the fact is I've wanted
something I can't have.  I don't want to baby about
it, only I'm,&mdash;well, I can't forget it here.  I'm
going to try a change.  Damn it!  What did I
say that for?  I hate to whine."
</p>

<p>
"Stuyv!" said John.  He reached across the
table, and squeezed the hand that was drawing
designs on the tablecloth with a strawberry
fork.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant felt the sympathy, and looked up.
The boy on the other side of the table gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Is it as bad as that?" he asked.  Stuyvesant
shook his head, and then he uttered his own
word and convincingly.  "Gosh, John," he said,
"it's the limit.  I'd never have believed it
possible."
</p>

<p>
"Would it help to tell?" asked John.  Stuyvesant
smiled a little.  "Not exactly," he replied.
"I did tell one person," he continued
after a pause, "and after that it was worse.
This person meant well too.  Rot it, if I
couldn't run a world better than it's run!  I'd
have people that love each&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped,
and looked wildly around.  Then he mopped
his forehead.  "It's awful hot," he finished
inanely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed John.  "Lord, I'll miss you!"  John
was utterly despondent.  "There's no
one like you, Stuyv," he said in an embarrassed
way.  "You know how hard it is to say
some things, but you can bet I know what
you've done for me!  I do&mdash;so does Cecilia.  I
had the wrong idea."
</p>

<p>
"I've been glad to be your friend," answered
Stuyvesant.  "You'll write me and tell me
how,&mdash;how you all are?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," responded John.  "Why, of
course I will, but I don't know how I can say
good-bye!  Stuyv, I depend on you awfully.
You know,&mdash;you know with dad, that is, I can't
take his advice because I don't respect him."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" broke in John's companion.
"I'd like to know why not?"
</p>

<p>
John's mouth flew open.  "His grammar&mdash;&mdash;"
he began.
</p>

<p>
"Trimmings," said K. Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Crudeness," said John.
</p>

<p>
"Companion of strength," said K. Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Mentioning money all the time," said John,
"how much things cost."
</p>

<p>
"Better than spending it without mention
on dubious objects."  John looked away as
Stuyvesant replied.  "Look here," continued
Stuyvesant, "you and I both know the honest
goodness in your father&mdash;his rugged ideas of
a decent life&mdash;his respect of them.  The other
things are tinsel balls on the Christmas tree.
Desirable trimmings, but not essential for the
tree's strength.  A few more years will
convince you,&mdash;absolutely convince you.  Some
day you won't even wince when your father
forgets and uses his knife to eat from."
</p>

<p>
"Never," stated John.
</p>

<p>
"You prefer a man who is slippery both
inside and out?" questioned Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"They get along better with the world," said
John.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Stuyvesant.  "They get along
better with the empties.  A few people, those
that count, look for something on the inside."
</p>

<p>
John suddenly leaned well across the table.
"Look here, Stuyv," he said, "is this a bluff?
Damned if I understand you!  I was lying
in the hammock on the porch last summer when
Marjory and Cecilia came from the courts.
They didn't see me, and I thought I'd hear
about some beau and have a joke.  I heard
Marjory say that you said the old man should
be kept in the garage.  Not just those words,
but smooth&mdash;Marjory's way.  I never saw
Celie so mad!  She turned white as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Did she say that?" shouted Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, Stuyv!" said John, "everybody's
lookin' at you.  Yes, of course she said that.
What's the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
"What else did she say?" asked Stuyvesant.
He was somewhat breathless, but for the sake
of John more restrained.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Marjory told Cecilia what a hell of a
case you had on her, talking about her eyes, and
all that kind of stuff.  Trust girls&mdash;they blab
everything.  Gimme the salt, will you?"
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant shoved his glass of water toward
John.  "The salt, man!" said John, and then
as he surveyed Stuyvesant with sad eyes, he
added, "I hope it isn't catching."
</p>

<p>
"You go telephone her that we're coming
out," said Stuyvesant.
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Your sister, of course.  Tell her not to have
any one else there.  I've got to see her, John,&mdash;got
to!  Honestly, John, I've <i>got</i> to.  I've got
to see her a little while alone.  I really must."
</p>

<p>
"I think you've made it plain," replied John.
"You say you must see Cecilia.  You did
mention that, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
There was no room for anything but heaven
in Stuyvesant.  He nodded seriously.  "Yes,"
lie answered, "I must!  Really, I've got to,
John!"
</p>

<p>
John howled.  "The heat!" he explained,
then he sobered.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Stuyv," he said, "<i>did</i> you say
that?"
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked Stuyvesant, then he remembered,
and for the first and last time made a
certain utterance.  "She lied," he said quietly,
and then, "Oh, my <i>gosh</i>, I'm happy!  I believe
I'm going crazy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" replied John, "impossible."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Yes, John?" said Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"Stuyv's coming out with me," she heard
him say.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Any one coming to dinner?"
</p>

<p>
"No, dear.  Shall I ask one of the Welsh
twins?  They're always so sweet about coming."
</p>

<p>
"No," said John; "Stuyv and I were talking
about dad, rather Marjory, and he's got a
hunch that he's got to see you alone.  Got
to,&mdash;got to,&mdash;got to!"  Cecilia did not
understand, and was rather bewildered at John's
laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly he shall, John," she replied.  Her
heart beat in her voice.  "Good-bye, dear," she
ended, and heard the click of his receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Talking of Marjory" ... Cecilia turned
away from the telephone and went to stand by
the sea window of her room.  She would help
them both all she could.  All she could....
She closed her eyes, for she felt sick and faint.
</p>

<p>
"How can I help him?" she questioned, for
Marjory's letters had not held a mention of
him, although Cecilia's had tactfully recorded
his every move.  She looked out on the
world&mdash;it was grey like the frothing Sound.
</p>

<p>
"I will help them to be happy," she
whispered unsteadily.  "Father McGowan-dear,&mdash;I
am learning.  Some day I will learn to
think of it, and smile&mdash;&mdash;"  Then she turned
to dress.
</p>

<p>
Norah came in, and looked on happily.  Cecilia
was not vain after all.  No, she didn't
care which frock she put on, and she told Josephine
not to fuss so over her hair, that it bored
her.  "What is the difference?" she had asked
a little bitterly, and then to Norah she had
said, "I didn't mean that!  I didn't!  What
made me say it?  I am not bitter, am I,
Norah?"
</p>

<p>
"And why should you be," Norah had answered,
"with everything in the world that
money can buy?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
PINK ROSES
</h3>

<p>
At five K. Stuyvesant and John started for
the Sound house.  The sun beat down cruelly
with the same murky, hot-damp feel.  The
car wove between the traffic of the crowded
streets like a huge shuttle.  Both men in it
were silent&mdash;Stuyvesant breathless and afraid
to trust his hope, yet hoping; John despondent
over Stuyv's going away.  All that that gentleman
had done came to John with a new force,&mdash;came
when the possibility of losing Stuyv
even for a few months was thrust before him.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Takes so long to get out to-day," he said;
"we seem to crawl.  Look at that fellow ahead.
Won't let us get past; have to crawl!  Lord!
Say, John, let me drive."
</p>

<p>
"I will not!" replied John with decision.  "I
have a distinct fondness for life.  What's wrong
with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," answered Stuyvesant loudly,
"nothing at all!"  Then he began to speak of
certain affairs downtown, talking quickly, as
if afraid of silence.  John looked at him with
wonder.  It was very unlike Stuyvesant to be
hectic.  He recalled the mentioned disappointment.
That, also, brought wonder.  Stuyvesant
didn't seem to care for girls.  In business
he seemed to get what he wanted.  What
could it be?  Suddenly an idea, which seemed
to John almost insane, flew across his mind.
</p>

<p>
He couldn't recognise it in the face of
Cecilia's and Stuyvesant's open avoidance of each
other, but in spite of that, the idea clung.
"Got to see her, got to&mdash;&mdash;" echoed in John's
ears.  He swallowed convulsively.  If it were
true!  And it was not Marjory after all,&mdash;well,
wouldn't he be the happiest fellow on
earth?  Well, rather!
</p>

<p>
The last months had brought John to a state
of adoration of Cecilia and Stuyvesant.  More
than love it was.  To be as sure of Stuyv's
always closeness,&mdash;to have Cecilia so cared
for....  "Can't you let her out a little?" he
heard Stuyvesant say impatiently.  John
answered with a gentleness absolutely new, but
it was not noticed.  He ran the car faster and
well, and his best efforts were greeted with:
"This thing seems to crawl to-night.  Darned
if I don't want to get out and push!"
</p>

<p>
"You're in a hurry!" said John bravely.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no!" answered Stuyvesant, looking
on John suspiciously.  Then he mopped his
forehead, leaving it streaked with the dust that
came off.  "Hot," he said.
</p>

<p>
They rounded the last hill before the Madden
gateway, and through a gap in some stately
poplars they caught a glimpse of a white speck
on an upper terrace.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia!" blurted out Stuyvesant.  "Oh,
gosh!  John, is my tie, that is, do I look&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, you do," said John, comfortingly.
Stuyvesant mopped some more.  His face
looked like a futurist painting of "The
Dancers" or some one's aunt.
</p>

<p>
They rounded up the hill slowly.  Evangeline
bounded from the shrubbery and barked
welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Evangeline," said Stuyvesant, as one in a
trance.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered John; "Norah named him
for Cecilia.  Norah is an old family servant."  Had
Stuyvesant heard, he might have smiled,
but Stuyvesant was past hearing.
</p>

<p>
"You poor boys!" said Cecilia.  "How hot
and tired you must be!"  Then she looked at
Stuyvesant and laughed.  "I judge it was
dusty?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"No, that is, I mean quite so," stuttered
Stuyvesant.  He stood before her silent, openly
staring.
</p>

<p>
When John saw Cecilia flush he put his hand
on Stuyvesant's arm.  "Come on," he said.
"We'll go brush up."
</p>

<p>
John's manner was as gentle as Cecilia's.
Stuyvesant followed him.  On the broad porch
he paused and looked back.
</p>

<p>
Evangeline was telling Cecilia that he loved
her, in dog fashion&mdash;wag code.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia patted him.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh!" said Stuyvesant, and then he
mopped his forehead, making another picture
in the dust.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dusk came before dinner time.  It crept
down stealthily, like the thief it is of day.
Shadows darkened and lengthened.  Greens
grew black.  Cecilia in the half light on a wide
porch watched a certain big and unusually
gruff man.  Something, she could see, was
making him like a wistful boy&mdash;a boy so
heart-set on his want that he fears the risk of refusal.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia thought of Marjory across the seas.
There was a chance to play traitor&mdash;a chance
to rekindle the little spark she had once fired
in Stuyvesant.  The idea danced about her
soul and burnt its edges.
</p>

<p>
"Father McGowan-dear," she appealed inside,
"please help me!  I am trying, but I <i>am</i>
so little!"  A breeze from the Sound came with
a swish and moaned gently in and out among
the loving arms of trees.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The lights in the dining room were soft.
They shone gently down on a large bowl of
pink roses which were in the centre of the
table.  Their hearts were a deeper colour and
they nodded and seemed to talk when the steps
of two pompous persons who passed things
shook them.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant looked at Cecilia and then
quickly away.  He did not know what kind of
a frock she wore except that it was white.  He
knew that she looked good, gentle and pure;
that her eyes held the depths that hurts bring
and the deep loyalty of love.  There was a
little droop to her lips that made him ache to
see.  He wondered at it, dared to hope that it
had come because of him, and then he put the
thought away.  Unbelievably sweet it seemed.
</p>

<p>
And Cecilia?
</p>

<p>
"Marjory across the seas," she thought, "to
subdue Jeremiah just a little&mdash;&mdash;"  She closed
her eyes.  "Oh dear!" she thought, "what <i>is</i>
the matter with me?  These awful thoughts!"  She
opened them again and saw Jeremiah
leaning on the table.  His fists were closed
about his knife and fork, and he held them
upright, the handle ends resting on the cloth.
John, curiously enough, did not seem bothered
by this.  He was watching Stuyvesant, who
sat opposite.
</p>

<p>
"After that I started makin' bricks instead
of layin' 'em.  (Celie, ask that young feller
to loan me a piece of bread.  I want bread
with my supper.  I don't care what the style
is.)  So I begin to make bricks, an' when I
look around and think that bricks done it
all&mdash;&mdash;"  Jeremiah's voice faded.  He left the
rest to the imaginations of his listeners, while
he laid a piece of bread flat on the table, and
spread it <i>en masse</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I wisht my wife could have saw it," said
Jeremiah as he loosened the piece of bread from
the cloth.  "She deserved everything.  I never
gave her nothing."
</p>

<p>
"You gave her a great deal," disagreed
Cecilia.  "You know you did!  We were happy
in that little flat.  I remember that.  We loved
each other and we had enough to eat."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was aware of Stuyvesant's eyes.
They were so dear!  She wondered if it was
very wicked to love them, for she knew she
always would....  And he had intimated
that if Jeremiah were less prominent&mdash;Cecilia
swallowed hard.  The gods are visited with
temptations, and too often they come to little
humans.  Cecilia was meeting hers.  For the
minute she felt anything possible, justifiable
for the end she craved, and in the middle of
her minute the white spark in her little heart
flared.
</p>

<p>
"Papa," she said, "please tell Mr. Twombly
about the time you hit the boss on the ear with
a brick."
</p>

<p>
The request of that tale was her crucifixion
on the cross of loyalty ... her proof beyond
all doubt that her heart was in Jeremiah's
rough old hands.  Jeremiah looked pleased.
His face lit rather pathetically.  Cecilia
answered his happy smile, and then she looked
down at her plate.  Her throat felt full and
stiff.  She found it hard to swallow.
</p>

<p>
Through a numbed consciousness she heard
a long and much loved tale.
</p>

<p>
"I love him, I love him!" she chanted inside.
"He and John are <i>everything</i>!"  She looked
up and found Stuyvesant looking at her.  The
way he looked made her gasp a little, and
below the table she closed her small hands so
tightly that her nails hurt her palms.
</p>

<p>
"An' then I sez, 'Yuh can lay yer own
bricks,'" came in the voice of Jeremiah.
"'An' here's one to begin with.' (It took him
on the ear.)"  He ended in parenthesis.
</p>

<p>
"Your stand for liberty&mdash;was&mdash;well&mdash;timed.
It was&mdash;certainly the best thing you could have
done," commented Stuyvesant in jerks.  He
was trying very hard not to look at Cecilia,
and it was work not to.
</p>

<p>
"Celie," said Jeremiah, "what <i>has</i> this fellow
did to the potatoes?  He does be-devil 'em so.
He puts on so many airs that yuh hardly
recognise 'em fer potatoes!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, dear," answered Cecilia, "but
I'll see about it to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Mebbe Celie couldn't fry potatoes!" said
Jeremiah.  He smacked his lips loudly in
remembrance.  "These here furriners," he went
on, "that we hire to cook,&mdash;poor things, <i>they</i>
don't know no better!"  And thus Jeremiah
disposed of French chefs.  The lips of one of
the pompous persons curled a little.  The roses
nodded and bobbed.
</p>

<p>
To Stuyvesant, who stared resolutely on
them, they all whispered, "Cecilia!"
</p>

<p>
To Cecilia they shouted "Keefer, the butler."
</p>

<p>
To John they were lovelier that night from
a new hope, and, of his father, a new
understanding.
</p>

<p>
But to Jeremiah Madden they brought back
only the heat of an overcrowded flat&mdash;the
woman who held his heart dying by inches,
when money might have made her live....
Money! ... A little tired-eyed girl struggling
under a woman's load.  A little boy who
always cried for things he couldn't have.
</p>

<p>
"The bunnit with pink roses."
</p>

<p>
Life's question mark,&mdash;Fate's smile,&mdash;or
God's hand?
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah looked away from the roses, and
absently stuck the corner of his napkin in his
collar.  Then he looked about to see if any one
had noticed, and hastily took it out.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia saw and her heart leaped with love.
It seemed to her that the Saints had made
Jeremiah do that then.  Do it to show the little
earth maiden her work in life.  The taking
from her father the shame which a son would
have him feel, and giving him a substitute for
the love that left him too soon,&mdash;too hungering.
</p>

<p>
They got up at last.  Cecilia took a bobbing
rose from the centrepiece.  She began to break
the thorns from it, but Stuyvesant's hands took
it from her.  He removed them methodically,
and surely,&mdash;as he would.  When he gave it
back to her, there was nothing left to hurt.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could take them out of the world
for you," he answered gruffly.  She shook as
she crossed the room to where her father and
John waited at the door.  Her temptation was
past.  Her heart was strong, but she prayed
that he would not say such things so much as
if he meant them.  It made it too hard.
</p>

<p>
"I am so weak," she thought, "so weak!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Stuyvesant walked laggingly across the soft
grass.  John had said that he would find her
by a white wall with a Greek relief, that that
was her favourite spot.  Stuyvesant knew that
he dreamed of that spot because of her, but
his connection with it influencing her, he never
thought of.  His spirit, always humble with
her, knelt.
</p>

<p>
He thought of John's understanding, and
whispering, "Good luck, Stuyv, dear!" and
of his gasping, "John,&mdash;you'd be willing?"  John
had whacked him on the back and had
answered convincingly.  Then he'd gone
unsteadily down the steps, and had lagged across
the close-clipped grass.  He wanted as he had
never wanted anything to see her, but he was
shaken and unsure ... sick from longing
and fear.
</p>

<p>
Ahead of him in the half light he saw the
stretch of wall standing out among the
shadows.
</p>

<p>
He stopped, heart pounding, at the corner
of the hedge-sheltered path.  The little Irish
maiden who was his key to heaven sat on the
wall.  Behind her the Sound was black.  The
soft stillness enveloped everything.  The half
night throbbed.  Cecilia looked up, and saw
the tall shadow in the shadows.
</p>

<p>
"John, dear?" she queried.  Stuyvesant
didn't answer for his voice was gone, but he
stepped toward her.  He put out a hand and
laid it on a white wall.  The world was reeling
for him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "I thought it was John,
but&mdash;but you wanted to see me?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Marjory&mdash;&mdash;" she began, then scolded herself
for a too abrupt start.  She drew a quick
breath, and tried to control reason and tact.
"She is so lovely, Mr. Stuyvesant," she went
on, "but sometimes she doesn't let people know
when she likes them.  She's like that."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia stopped and gasped.  It was harder
than she had dreamed.
</p>

<p>
"Has she been a good friend to you?" asked
Stuyvesant in a queer, tight voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" answered Cecilia, "so good!  I
do love her so much!  I would do anything
to make her happy!"
</p>

<p>
"You <i>darling</i>!" said K. Stuyvesant.  He
spoke loudly, but his words shook, for his heart
was pounding with a sickening speed.  With
his words Cecilia caught her breath so deeply
that it seemed a sob.  Doubts vanished,&mdash;seemed
incredible,&mdash;but she spoke what would
always be her truth, though her heart famished
from it.  She looked Stuyvesant squarely
in the eyes: "I love my father," she said, "and
I am proud of him.  I am proud to be his
daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you are," he answered.  "You
should be.  Cecilia, I am very little, but I am
large enough to see what you love in him.
Have you misunderstood what I thought?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  White, she was, and her eyes
were on his face, imploring in their new hope.
</p>

<p>
"I loved you," said Stuyvesant, "on the boat.
I saw how wonderful you were, but, Cecilia,&mdash;when
I saw you here!  When I see you turn
and kiss your father when his eyes grow hurt
because of John's unkindness....  Oh, my
dear!  Every instant of this year I've loved
you, and more and more.  I love you so
... No one could be worthy of you, but, little
Saint,&mdash;no one could love you more!  No one."
</p>

<p>
He stopped, choked.  "I dream on my knees,"
he went on: "I'll dream of you until I die.
But,&mdash;what's the use of saying all this?  I love
you!  I love you so!  That's everything."
</p>

<p>
He put a hand out toward her, then drew
back.  "Cecilia," he whispered, "you are so
sweet!"
</p>

<p>
He looked down and drew his breath sharply.
He wondered if she would ever speak.
</p>

<p>
He heard her slip from the wall....
Perhaps she would leave him without a word.
Dully, he wondered how he could go on living
if she did that.
</p>

<p>
And then the world turned over and then
it ceased to be, for Cecilia's hands lay on his
shoulders.  He felt them move and creep up
and around his neck.  It was true....  He
felt a wonderful, shaken strength.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia!  Cecilia!" she heard him gasp.
</p>
